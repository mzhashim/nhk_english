WHY DON'T YOU TELL MIKE ROSS TO TAKE A HIKE?
- HE CAN STAY.
- OKAY.
YOU SEE, 95 OF YOUR PLAINTIFFS
HAVE ALREADY CALLED ME ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE REST OF THEM SEE THE LIGHT.
I WIN.
- I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME YOU CHECKED,
BUT AS OF THIS MORNING
ALL 200 OF MY PLAINTIFFS ARE STAYING WITH ME.
- BULLSHIT.
- I GOT THEM AN ADVANCE AGAINST THEIR SETTLEMENT.
- NO FINANCE COMPANY IN THEIR RIGHT MIND
WILL BACK YOUR SUIT.
- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY TAUGHT YOU MATH AT YALE,
BUT THAT'S 5 MILLION.
$25,000 A PLAINTIFF.
EXACTLY WHAT YOU TRIED TO BUY THEM OFF FOR.
