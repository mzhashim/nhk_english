Angela Nash: Hello, Mr. Ohtaki. My name is Angela Nash. I'm an executive recruiter with an agency called Harper & Hay. Is it a good time to talk or shall I call you later at your convenience.
Ohtaki Reiji: It's OK. What can I do for you?
Nash: I wonder if you could help me with an assignment I'm working on. One of the top ten public relations firms in the United States is looking for someone to fill a position in its Food and Nutrition Division. I wonder if you could think of someone in your professional field who might be qualified.
Ohtaki: Of course, I know a lot of colleagues in my field, but could you tell me more about it first?
Nash: Sure. I'm looking for a high-caliber communications person, preferably a nutritionist, who is bilingual and has had experience with Western companies.
Ohtaki: That's a tall order. Well, actually, that's a job I may be interested in knowing more about.
Nash: I must admit the thought crossed my mind. I understand you
spent some time in New York. Is that right?
Ohtaki: I spent three years in New York on company assignment. I came back here to Osaka last year.
Nach: How would you feel about going back to New York?
Ohtaki: Me? New York? I have mixed feelings.
