<div id="id_L01_01">L01-01</div>
Angela Nash: Hello, Mr. Ohtaki. My name is Angela Nash. I'm an executive recruiter with an agency called Harper & Hay. Is it a good time to talk or shall I call you later at your convenience.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji: It's OK. What can I do for you?</br>
Nash: I wonder if you could help me with an assignment I'm working on. One of the top ten public relations firms in the United States is looking for someone to fill a position in its Food and Nutrition Division. I wonder if you could think of someone in your professional field who might be qualified.</br>
Ohtaki: Of course, I know a lot of colleagues in my field, but could you tell me more about it first?</br>
Nash: Sure. I'm looking for a high-caliber communications person, preferably a nutritionist, who is bilingual and has had experience with Western companies.</br>
Ohtaki: That's a tall order. Well, actually, that's a job I may be interested in knowing more about.</br>
Nash: I must admit the thought crossed my mind. I understand you</br>
spent some time in New York. Is that right?</br>
Ohtaki: I spent three years in New York on company assignment. I came back here to Osaka last year.</br>
Nach: How would you feel about going back to New York?</br>
Ohtaki: Me? New York? I have mixed feelings.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L01_02">L01-02</div>
Ohtaki: New York is an exciting city and everyone is so bright and briskly efficient in getting things done. On the other hand, that ghastly tragedy last year has cast a pall over New York as a safe place to live and work. For my family's sake as well as my own, I would have serious second and even third thoughts about taking on a new jobthere.</br>
Nash: I can understand that. However, New York has begun to bounce back by beefing up security in airports, individual businesses and onthe streets.</br>
Ohtaki: I'm happy to hear that. Frankly, I'm not all that happy with my present position. My company is downsizing and job security is at anall-time low. I may not be here in the next year or so. Just out of curiosity, can you be a bit more specific about the firm you mentioned?</br>
Nash: At the moment I can't be more specific, but if you would like toconsider the job opportunity, why don't we get together for dinner?</br>
Ohtaki: I'd like that. Do I need to prepare anything in advance?</br>
Nash: Please update your resume and bring it with you. We can take it from there. </br>
Ohtaki: I'll put together a working draft and maybe we can whip it into shape over dinner, if that's all right.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L01_03">L01-03</div>
Nash: Thank you for your resume. I note that you are a licensed nutritionist. That's fantastic. Your professional credentials are very impressive. All the basic information is fine, but let me give you a few suggestions to polish it and give it a better structure.</br>
Ohtaki: Yes, please. My resume is years out of date, and it's the firsttime I've had to write a resume in English.</br>
Nash: Not bad for the first try. Let's see. For starters, you should put your personal data into sections with headers like education, past and present employment, your present job title and responsibilities, achievements, and any citations, awards or other honors you may have received. You don't need to list your hobby or the fact that youhave a driver's license. They're irrelevant.</br>
Ohtaki: What's the most important section?</br>
Nash: Put the finest focus on achievements and back it up with hard facts. Once that stands out, the rest of the resume will fall into place.In addition to section headings, keep your paragraphs short and use neat margins for easier reading. Proof read well for typos.</br>
Ohtaki: What about typefaces? Should they all be the same or varied?</br>
Nash: Use a couple of different typefaces, maybe bold face for section heads and plain text in between.</br>
Ohtaki: OK I think I can do it up over the coming weekend.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L01_04">L01-04</div>
Nash: Now, I need to ask if you could give serious consideration to this job offer in New York. I don't need an unequivocal yes or no- just atentative nod so I can give you more details.</br>
Ohtaki: Please. I'm all ears.</br>
Nash: OK. The position is with Pearson Worldwide, a member of the Galaxy Group. With the increasing emphasis on nutrition in food and beverage promotion, Pearson needs a professional nutritionist to come aboard in order to create more credible and powerful communication campaigns for its clients.</br>
Ohtaki: It's much the same trend we have here in Japan. However, I'm still not clear on exactly how Pearson would expect me to contribute to public relations campaigns. </br>
Nash: I can't spell that out for you in detail. Are you interested enough to sit down and talk it over with Dean Reese? He heads up international public relations at Pearson and will be here in Osaka for a few dayslater this month.</br>
Ohtaki: As long as a prior commitment to the job offer isn't required, I'd like very much to meet him and then mull the whole promise to make my final decision in a few dochance to chat.</br>
Nash: That's great. As you said, New Yorkers are brisk and efficient, They put a high value on decisive decisive people. I'll set up the meeting.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_01">L02-01</div>
Ohtaki Reiji: That's the gist of it. I met the headhunter and agreed to dothe job interview. I wonder if I can trust a headhunter.</br>
Len Jensen: Trust her? You lucky dog. You're stuck in a company that's shrinking like a punctured balloon. You could be pink-slipped in the next six months. Now this lovely lady shows up, waves her magic wand, and suddenly you've a whole new shot at the future. Trust me when I say trust her.</br>
Natalie Nakayama: I agree. Look, Reiji, I can understand your qualms about quitting and moving back to New York. After all, you've been back in Japan for hardly more than a year. You'll have to pull the kids out of their Japanese school and put them back into an American school all over again. They may feel like ping-pong balls. And maybe Miyoko is scared to death of anthrax and all that. You'll have to decide what's best for all concerned in the next five to ten years.</br>
Ohtaki: You've got that right. In the meantime, the headhunter has given me tons of advice on job-changing strategies. She's also feeding me good tips on how to shape up for my job interview. I needed that. When it comes to making a good first impression at an American public relations firm, I didn't have a clue. She set me on the right track.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_02">L02-02</div>
Boris Barakov: If it's no secret, what did she have to say?</br>
Ontaki: She gave me a stack of background data on the company,including the latest annual report. Going through all that can help me come up with a list of questions to ask. Don't sit there like a stick in the mud, she said. Don't simply answer questions. Be assertive and speak up to show interest in what you could expect if you take the job. What's the corporate culture? How about its job turnover?</br>
Jensen: Turnover is an important issue. If new employees sign on and then split in a year or two, you've got a company that functions like a　revolving door.</br>
Barakov: You don't get a second chance to make a good first impression, as they say, but you need to make the right kind of personal statement too. I've done job interviews on both sides of the fence, so I know how much a first impression counts.</br>
Jensen: The first time I applied for a job I came half an hour late. Strike one. I hadn't shaved and I wore a T-shirt and jeans. Strike two. The guy asked me right off what I thought I could offer the company. I shook my head and said I hadn't thought about that. For my first I asked what the company could offer me. Strike three. I was shown the door.</br>
Ohtaki: [Laughing] I can imagine why.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_03">L02-03</div>
Baerakov: Years ago, when I was still wet behind the ears, the toughest question for me was what did I value? Nowadays, when I ask that question in an interview, the candidates often wince the way I used to. We all have a general idea of the kind of workplace we like, but more often than not we haven't put it into words, so the question leaves usdumbfounded.</br>
Ohtaki: In my case, job security is important, as is having a clear idea of what I'm supposed to do. I don't want to have to constantly guess where my responsibilities end and where my coworkers' begin. That leads to confusion and a lack of accountability.</br>
Nakayama: I can feel for you. I like a well-structured workplace too, but I value a certain amount of freedom and flexibility. I worked for one company where job rules and regulations were so rigid that I felt likeI had to ask for special permission to go to the bathroom. That sort of atmosphere can be stifling, and as a result, my motivation went downhillst. When I quit, I kicked my heels in pure glee.</br>
Barakov: As manager of a trading company I can see tangible results from what we do, how much product we sell, whether it's breakfast cereal or mandarin oranges. Seeing our success directly reflected in sales figures is really gratifying and is something I value a great deal.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_04">L02-04</div>
Ohtaki: Another question I sometimes grappled with is whether the kind of work I did had any real benefit to others. It wasn't until I appeared on TV talk shows and got a lot of viewer mail that I had real proof that people appreciated what I had to say. Nutrition is a basic issue for most people.</br>
Nakayama: So now you know you do make a difference. I took your advice and that's why I get my protein from tofu instead of red meat and am eating more fruit and veggies than in the past.</br>
Jensen: I'm sure my work benefits people in some way, even if I can't put my finger on it the way Reiji can. If I needed to see direct benefits, I would have become a doctor or teacher.</br>
Barakov: For me, good management isn't a master-servant relationship. I like to manage by motivating my staff to do what is best for the company and for their own development. I'm not running a sweatshop.</br>
Ohtaki: I'm making mental notes on what I value. I have a sneaking suspicion that questions of that kind will come up in the interview.</br>
Barakov:They may also ask you what you would like to be doing and what you hope to have accomplished in the next five to ten years. I'd mark that down as something to chew on before you go in for the interview.</br>
Obtaki: Thank you, everybody. You've been a great help.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_01">L03-01</div>
Dean Reese:Come in. Mr. Ohtaki. Please sit down and make yourself comfortable. Would you like something to drink?</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:I could use some water, please.</br>
Reese:OK. I've read through your resume and I'm very pleased with what I see. I see that you are a licensed nutritionist. You've been with your present pharmaceutical company for 10 years?</br>
Ohtaki:That's right. I joined the public relations department immediately after graduation and have been there ever since.</br>
Reese:Supposing you stay with the company, what is your prospect for further promotion?</br>
Ohtaki:I'm afraid the prospect is dim. The company is not doing too well in the present economic recession here in Japan. One reason I was recalled from New York was that it became too expensive to keep me there in view of the need to cut costs. Since then, a first wave of layoffs reduced staffing in most departments by almost 20 percent, with a second wave in the offing.</br>
Reese:Then it may be high time to consider your options and move on. Let me tell you a bit about Pearson Worldwide. We have several divisions, including one that services clients in the food and nutrition field. Now we're about to take on two more major clients and we feel keen need to have our own nutrition expert in-house as a member of our team.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_02">L03-02</div>
Reese:Are you with me so far?</br>
Ohtaki:Sure. I have one one question, though. Why me?</br>
Reese:Well, we need someone who is more than a run-of-the-mill dietitian , someone who can fit comfortably into our team and relate to our clients with ease. Japan is a major market for the two clients I just mentioned, and you would be doing a lot of liaison work between the two countries.</br>
Ohtaki:That sounds like a challenging job.</br>
Reese:It certainly is. You're a promising candidate because of your background. You've got the right credentials and your three years in New York has given you valuable cross-cultural experience. There aren't many people who can fill the bill.</br>
Ohtaki:I'm beginning to see what you mean. May I ask you some questions?</br>
Reese:Sure. By all means.</br>
Ohtaki:What kinds of people do you employ?</br>
Reese:We have account service teams, writers and illustrators, marketing sharpshooters, media mavens, research experts, lawyers, accountants, human resource specialists-just about every type of professional. Our staff has a very broad spectrum of talent and skills, which helps when it comes to satisfying our clients' individual needs.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_03">L03-03</div>
Ohtaki:Do the people you hire tend to stay with Pearson for a long time?</br>
Reese:Yes, I'm happy to say they do, because Pearson feels like a family. We have a kind of close-knit tradition and, believe me, we reward our people well for their contributions. May I ask you a question now? I know that you're married and have two grade-school children. How! do your wife and kids feel about living in New York again?</br>
Ohtaki:My wife is deeply disturbed about what happened last September, but she said it's my decision to make about what I want for my future. She knows I'm feeling stuck in my current position and hardly happy about it.</br>
Reese:I understand. How about your children?</br>
Ohtaki:Their answer bowled me over. They don't like the school system here, including the uniforms and endless rules, right down to how many centimeters of toilet paper they can use. They're begging me to put them back into an American school.</br>
Reese:I'd like to throw a few more questions at you. Are you computer literate?</br>
Ohtaki:Yes, I am. Nutritionists need computers for, say, analyzing the ingredients in a new product that has been proposed or information exchange with fellow nutritionists.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_04">L03-04</div>
Reese:How do you think Japan's economy will perform this year? Do you think the country will be able to find its way out of the recession soon?</br>
Ohtaki:I'm not an expert on that subject, but judging from the past ten years and the shape my company is in right now, I'm not too optimistic about the short run. Even the United States seems to have run out of steam and is in the doldrums. That doesn't bode well for the global economy.</br>
Reese:On a more personal note, what did you like most and least about New York?</br>
Ohtaki:I loved the Major League baseball games, sitting in the stands with a hot dog in one hand and a cold beer in the other. What I liked least was the fear of getting mugged when walking alone. In between those two extremes I liked New York's energy. There is never a dull moment there.</br>
Reese:Very well. Now, could you give me a tentative commitment to the job offer so I can authorize an Osaka-New York round-trip with all es paid? You can meet the people who would be on your team and they can brief you on what they expect from you.</br>
Ohtaki:Yes, I can agree to that.</br>
Reese:Then thank you for taking time out for this interview. Expect to hear from me in two to three days.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_01">L04-01</div>
Hiram White:Welcome to Pearson Worldwide, Mr. Ohtaki. I'm White, general manager of the Food and Nutrition Division.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. White.</br>
White:Please call me Hiram. And may I call you Reiji? We're all on a first-name basis here.</br>
Ohtaki:Reiji is fine.</br>
White:All right then, Reiji. Let me introduce you to our team. Meet Fisk, Hopkins and Sanchez, our account people, and Lyon, our administrative assistant.</br>
Heidi Ohtaki:I'm delighted to meet all of you.</br>
White:Let's be seated and get started. Apart from Food and Nutrition, Pearson has four other divisions called Workplace Communications, Corporate Communications, Brand Marketing and Technology. We have branch offices in major cities all over the globe. We've also won awards year after year, for innovative and high-impact public relations campaigns.</br>
Minna Fisk:Our division is about to take on two major clients. One is Nelson ABC Foods, which has recently changed its name to Nelsonex Inc. after acquisition of a number of other companies in related fields such as automated lines for bottling, canning and other packaging. Our second new client will be Chow Down, a pet food manufacturer.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_02">L04-02</div>
Don Hopkins:Both companies use McMillan & Burton as their ad agency, but were using another company within the Galaxy Group for their public relations needs.</br>
Anita Sanchez:Nelson and Chow Down have become too huge for them to handle. That's why M&B asked us to lend a hand.</br>
White:We need to have someone on our team who can talk to physicians and academics in their own lingo and then brief us in layman's terms on the important points. If we're asked to promote almonds, for example, we need to know why almonds have health value before we can design a promotional campaign.</br>
Ohtaki:I think I get the picture.</br>
Fisk:prepared this packet for you with information on our company culture, plus detailed info on each of our divisions and their clients, bios of our team and the management team, as well as summaries of past award-winning campaigns.</br>
Heidi Ohtaki:Thank you, I'll go through it all at the hotel tonight.</br>
White:OK. It's about time to break for lunch. After that we'll take you on a grand tour of the facilities. We've included a chance for a chat with Haydn, our human resources manager. She will be happy to answer any questions you may have about our HR policies.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_03">L04-03</div>
Iris White:Your resume says that you spent three years in New York, so you're no stranger to this city. Have you noticed any changes since you arrived here?</br>
Ohtaki:Security inside the airport is much stricter. Even so, it seemed I got off rather lightly. Unfortunately, there isn't the same tight security on the perimeter. When I got in line to catch a cab, I heard someone right behind me cry out. A lady had dropped her handbag. I bent down to help her pick up everything that had fallen out. When I straightened up, my laptop computer had vanished. I'm still wondering if she set me up and her partner in crime swiped my laptop.</br>
Sanchez:That's a bummer if I ever heard one. Was it insured?</br>
Ohtaki:Yes. I can replace it when I get back to Osaka. The insurance company will pay for it. All of my important files are backed up on CD, so that's no loss, but at the moment I can't send or receive any e-mail. How are people who live here feeling in the aftermath of September 11? Did you lose anybody on the staff in the attack on the World Trade Center?</br>
White:Fortunately we didn't, but three of our recent alumni who had joined clients with offices in those buildings died that day. We were devastated at first. Many of us feel that we're still not back to normal.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_04">L04-04</div>
White:If you do come on board, Reiji, would you choose to live in the city?</br>
Ohtaki:I'm thinking of moving back to the town in New Jersey where I lived during my previous time here. There was a sizable Japanese community. It also had a fine school system. My wife and kids were very happy there and I'm sure they would like to have the chance to see some old friends again. As much as I liked working in New York, I was not at all keen on living in the city. I prefer the more relaxed pace of the suburbs.</br>
Fisk:Other than housing, do you have other considerations about the new job?</br>
Ohtaki:Most of the issues are settled. My only question now is-when can I start?</br>
Hopkins:That's great. You see, Reiji, I worked elsewhere for several years before Pearson recruited me. I never felt comfortable in that earlier job, because it was a chaotic workplace. At times I dreaded going in the next morning. I've never felt that way at Pearson. I'm sure you'll enjoy working with us here.</br>
White:Some of us need to make personal adjustments to work on a sun team. I know I did. Well, Reiji, let's head back to the office and go on in the corporate tour.</br>
Ohtaki:I'm looking forward to it.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_01">L05-01</div>
Hiram White:Reiji, let me say that we're pleased and proud to have you on the team. We're setting up a series of meetings with our clients' nutrition experts so that you can liaise with them as needed from now present on.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Thank you. I'm certainly interested in meeting them all and asking them about their current and future product development plans. I'm sure they'll be able to give me great background information. Any word on what's coming up with our two newest clients?</br>
Minna Fisk:We already know that Nelsonex is developing a mixture of dried fruits and nuts that are known from recent research to have excellent health benefits. We've also had a briefing from Chow Down and M&B on a new line of cat foods best suited to kittens, mature cats or cats in old age. The nutrition mixtures are different for each age range.</br>
Ohtaki:OK. It looks like I have a lot on my plate. I also understand that quite a number of clients in this division donated food, cash and other types of contributions in the wake of last year's disaster. Did Pearson have a hand in that?</br>
White:We definitely did. All of our divisions got in touch with our clients to propose different ways that they could lend a helping hand, but not in a self-serving way.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_02">L05-02</div>
White:We offered to pitch in on their behalf at no extra charge. We kept a very low profile.</br>
Fisk:Our financial PR division found out that five people had died in the office of one of our investment service clients. We talked to the client and agreed to draw up a document that outlined how the client could help the victims' families cope.</br>
White:Pearson, in turn, sent out press releases on memorial services and assisted with contact between the volunteers and the media. Sometimes that latter task wasn't easy, because of the fine line between news and the family's right to privacy. Happily, our people finessed it with no hard feelings on either side.</br>
Fisk:All of us here at Pearson felt a need to contribute whatever we could. It seemed perfectly natural to pick up the phone and ask how we could help. Our healthcare division helped a hospital with a trauma center close to the disaster site. Its small PR team couldn't deal with a hundred media phone calls per hour, so we dispatched volunteers to work rotating shifts night and day.</br>
White:Reiji, please understand that what we did was not unique. All sorts of companies were willing and eager to provide any kind of assistance necessary. The tragedy had galvanized our American spirit. Donations poured in from coast to coast and even from overseas.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_03">L05-03</div>
Fisk:Even kids got into the act. They were too young to donate blood, but found other creative ways they could contribute. One group of teens held weekend car washes and donated all of the proceeds to relief efforts. They raised thousands of dollars and the idea caught on all across the country, bringing in tens of thousands of dollars in the process.</br>
Ohtaki:Wow. I am impressed.</br>
White:On the other hand, there were some people who didn't get the goodwill message, like the franchise coffee shop manager near the twin towers who charged rescuers $130 for water to treat victims. People raised hell. The company's president issued an apology that was posted in all of the chain's stores.33230</br>
Fisk:Businesses of all kinds are fearful that their brand might be damaged by an employee blunder that offends public opinion. We've been called on to do much more counseling on how to keep customers pleased with brand messages that suit the prevailing mood in the nation.</br>
White:We're still feeling extremely sensitive about what happened, especially those of us who live in New York. Anything that ignores that feeling or, even worse, smacks of exploitation, would create a backlash against the company in question. We've had to explain that to all of our foreign clients.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_04">L05-04</div>
Fisk:We don't necessarily need to lie low, but we do need to keep a finger on the public pulse. Put out no message that could possibly be misconstrued as offensive to American consumers, especially at a time when patriotic fever is running high.</br>
Ohtaki:In this kind of environment, are you optimistic about the future of our business, Hiram?</br>
White:Economic downturns are often fertile ground for consultants like us who have the right skill sets and, more important, the right frame of mind. It's another business cycle.</br>
Ohtaki:People do seem to be breathing easier. There seems to be less fear of another disaster or an anthrax epidemic.</br>
Fisk:For a while I was using gloves to open my mail. Now I don't. Iris doesn't have as many nerve-wracked employees coming to her for counseling.</br>
Iris White:Stress levels are down. We're slowly getting back into the swing of things. People working in the Empire State Building and other high-rise office towers are not as jittery.</br>
Fisk:That's true. Security here at Pearson is easing off a bit, although it's still tighter than it was before 9/11. We're not as on edge as we were in the weeks following the attacks, but we will never forget what happened. In the back of my mind I'm still shell-shocked.</br>

Hiram White:Good afternoon, Lee. Let's join and Reiji in the conference room. Would you like a cup of tea or coffee? Lee Seymour: I'd love a cup of tea. Has Reiji briefed you on his visit to the Nelsonex test kitchen?</br>
Minna White:He sure did. He had quite a chat with Sue Ellen Metz, a fellow nutritionist and a cooking instructor. Here we are.</br>
Minna Fisk:Hi, Lee. Please have a seat and let's get started. Reiji, just to refresh our memories, could you sum up your session with Sue Ellen again?</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Sure. What she has in mind is a Nelsonex-funded campaign to teach people how to cook. She told me about a best seller back in the 1950s called Why Johnny Can't Read. It was about a generation of kids with literacy problems due to a new-fangled, but flawed teaching technique. Now, in 2002, there's a new kind of crisis that we might call Why Johnny Can't Cook. Seymour: The reason why many young adults can't cook goes back three decades when mothers began trading in their aprons for business suits. As a result, their children missed out on the cooking lessons they used to learn by helping out in the kitchen.</br>
Fisk:In effect, home cooking ended up on the back burner in the homes of career-minded mothers. Now, we've got a generation of young working couples who are cooking illiterate.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_02">L06-02</div>
White:In other words, they didn't learn cooking at home and it isn't taught in school, apart from a few lessons in home ec class. Now, as young adults, they need to be responsible for grocery shopping and in cooking, but they don't have a clue about how to prepare a full meal from scratch.</br>
Ohtaki:That seems to be the case, but I can see why they wouldn't bother to learn. It's so easy to pick up takeout food at a supermarket and nuke it in a microwave. On the other hand, home cooking can take a couple of hours. Who's got that kind of time? Seymour: I know I don't, and neither does my husband. We eat good food, but we don't spend much time in the kitchen. I'm one of the illiterate. I don't know much about cookery beyond how to poach eggs or bake a cake.</br>
White:It sounds like cooking isn't the household chore it used to be. Some young people cook for the fun of it, but that reduces cooking to a hobby. Nelsonex did a survey earlier this year that revealed that one in four adults eats some kind of convenience meal most nights of the week. Six out of ten eat fast food at least once a week.</br>
Fisk:Eating out certainly is popular.</br>
Ohtaki:However, there was a positive response from young adults to the survey question that interested Sue Ellen the most: "If cooking could be quick and simple, would you like to learn how?"</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_03">L06-03</div>
Ohtaki:Even here at Pearson, we have younger people like who would sign up for a cooking seminar in a second. Seymour: Count me in too. What Sue Ellen has in mind is a series of seminars in half a dozen cities, including New York, that would be hosted by major companies for their employees. M&B will deal with advertising needs to plug the campaign. What's needed from Pearson is a media packet, with press releases, Sue Ellen's bio and an illustrated booklet that includes a simple introduction followed by sections on menu planning, recipes, utensils and techniques.</br>
Anita White:Maybe we could lead off with a section titled "Beyond Boiling Water." We need to appeal to the young consumer who wonders why he or she should cook when there are so many other options available, whether it's dining out at restaurants or ordering from the local take-out joint.</br>
Fisk:Well, let's see. Home cooking is convenient. There are many quick and simple meals that will fit into your schedule. Fish or meat fresh from the oven or grill smells and tastes wonderful. Salads can be tossed in a minute or so. You can brown-bag homemade sandwiches and add leftover salad for lunch. It's delicious and helps you save a few dollars along the way.</br>
Ohtaki:Good points, Minna.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_04">L06-04</div>
Ohtaki:Now, when we cover menu planning, we should mention that the recipes are color-coded to tell you what goes well with what. For instance, the fruit-and-nut breakfast muffin is a good match with scrambled eggs and fruit salad. ut salad. Seymour: Let's include a checklist, too. First you read the recipe and make sure you have all the ingredients you need. If you don't, then scribble a shopping list. Do you have all the tools you need a baster, a grater, a pastry brush?</br>
White:Right, then turn to the section on cooking techniques if you're not sure what to do. Sue Ellen has listed them in alphabetical order, but she hasn't defined them. For example, how would you define basting?</br>
Fisk:It's drizzling a liquid over meat to make it moist and taste better. Next is deglazing. It's not as easy to explain. After you roast meat, you add wine or broth to the juice left in the pan, then reheat it. You pour it over the meat just before you serve it. in</br>
White:I have one more idea for the campaign. The seminars are fine, but why don't we include a free offer for the booklet in the media packet? The booklet will get much bigger circulation if the offer appears in the print and broadcast media. Seymour: That's a bright idea, Hiram. It'll add a lot of value to Nelsonex's campaign.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_01">L07-01</div>
Hiram White:Good morning all. Let me introduce Paul Payne, our new CS0-chief security officer. Paul is visiting each division today to get acquainted and answer any questions you may have. 22</br>
Minna Fisk:I don't mean any disrespect--and no hard feelings, please―but why a security officer now? I thought security has been loosening up in the past couple of months. Paul Payne: No offense taken. And that's a reasonable question. My first assignment here at Pearson is to examine existing security measures and to recommend improvements that will give Pearson a system that guarantees maximum safety for all employees.</br>
Heidi Lyon:We would all welcome that if it weren't too invasive. Will we be subjected to metal detectors and body scans when we come to work? Payne: No, ma'am, not if you're a bona fide Pearson employee. You will have a new type of ID card to prove you belong here, but there will be strict checks on outsiders.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:I have a question. Why didn't this happen six months ago? Why the delay in hiring you?</br>
White:Let me answer that, Reiji. In the immediate wake of the 9/11 disaster, we asked headhunters to find a qualified security officer. Hundreds of other companies did the same, and as you might expect, demand quickly exceeded supply.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_02">L07-02</div>
White:Security officers became hot commodities, and Pearson took a place on a long waiting list. We're lucky to have Paul with us at long last. Many companies are still waiting for a security officer.</br>
Fisk:I understand around half of our biggest clients have chief security officers. I'll bet that the others are clamoring for them now as well.</br>
White:Middle-size and small companies can't afford to hire full-time CSOs, so instead they set up security training programs for their employees. Pearson considered that option, but finally decided to go with a pro on staff. Post fort ath</br>
Lyon:What will you deal with specifically? Payne: Apart from entry procedures, I'll create measures for evacuating Pearson's people if there's a bomb threat, handling mail in view of the anthrax scare and safeguarding your computers against potent viruses.</br>
Ohtaki:Paul, are you thinking of installing security cameras or redesigning our ventilation system to ward off anthrax spores? Payne: I can't answer that definitively right now, but I can say those are two items on my immediate agenda. Whatever final recommendations I make, please rest assured that security will be discreet, not a slap in the face.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_03">L07-03</div>
Fisk:That's a relief. I've seen TV reports on building owners who have constructed street-level barricades to fend off car and truck bombs. Out in California, one bank has surrounded its headquarters building with a concrete moat.</br>
White:And that's only outdoor security. For indoor security, some options are metal detectors at entrances or mirrors to see what's under a car as it goes into an underground garage.</br>
Lyon:You mentioned computer viruses, Paul, and that is a constant threat. Are there other major threats to information stored in our computers? Payne: A disaster can ruin a hard disk and cause all of the information to be lost. Businesses that deal with sensitive information have to protect it at all costs. Their auditors and shareholders demand that. That's why emergency procedures are necessary, such as a back-up taping system that records all data and stores it elsewhere. That's done every single day to duplicate files automatically.</br>
Ohtaki:I've heard about redundant systems that can be used to rebuild data networks in a couple of hours in case of emergency. One way to be sure that information is safe is to keep it in different computers in locations far apart from each other.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_04">L07-04</div>
White:Getting back to other security measures, have you heard about the new screening devices to be installed at airports? Apparently they employ biometric technologies to recognize faces or fingerprints. Fingerprint scanners are already in use at a number of American airports. Flight crews and airport employees are required to use them to board airplanes or go out on runways. I wonder if that may expand to passengers as well.</br>
Fisk:Suppose these devices are installed not only in airports but even at stores, offices, street corners, city parks and parking garages. We could be under constant surveillance just about everywhere outside our own homes. I'd feel like Big Brother was watching me every time I stepped outside. Talk about creepy.</br>
White:I hear you, but many of us feel that we need to sacrifice some of our personal freedom in favor of more security. After all, feeling safe and secure is what concerns us most at the moment.</br>
Lyon:Security is our new national watchword. Look at what's been going on. We have reservists guarding our hydroelectric dams and power plants, and aerial patrols over concerts in Central Park.</br>
Ohtaki:All that indicates real fear of what high-profile target could be next on the terrorist agenda. Payne: It's a scary world out there, but if it's any comfort, it will be my mission to make sure you have full security on the job.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_01">L08-01</div>
Hiram White:It looks like the comfort-food binge is over. People are rediscovering a healthy diet.</br>
Peter Neeson:And it's about time. My sister was a strict dieter. She never touched fast food, and always turned down second helpings. A few days after 9/11 she said to herself, why bother? Forget the carrot and celery sticks. Why not pig out on buffalo wings, corn dogs and hot fudge sundaes while I still have the chance?</br>
Anita Sanchez:That was one of the mass reactions, like if we can't count on tomorrow, let's live it up today. Carpe diem! Diets went out the window. Smokers who had quit lit up again. Some of my formerly homebody friends turned into bar-hoppers and hit the dance clubs every night.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:It sounds like a doomsday scenario. Did they really believe the end of the world was at hand?</br>
White:Well, not everyone reacted that way, but I think that most people decided to take a second look at their priorities. I found solace at my synagogue, and like a lot of my neighbors, I stuck close to home with my family.</br>
Neeson:I was just the opposite. I used to eat out no more than two or three times a month, but after the attacks, I couldn't stand to be alone so I went to restaurants every night for the next few months.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_02">L08-02</div>
Neeson:I used food as a stress reliever and must admit I did a lot of damage to my waistline.</br>
Sanchez:You weren't the only one, Peter. As you know, our clients in the health food industry saw their sales plummet. Bookstores were hurting hurt too. Diet books have been perennial best sellers, but not after September. Like Peter's sister, who cared about dieting anymore?</br>
Ohtaki:It sounds like our Food and Nutrition division was hardest hit. Did any clients cancel their communication programs?</br>
White:Not entirely, but more than a few of them put special campaigns on hold. How can you run a successful campaign on the health benefits of a good diet if people don't give a damn? We're waiting another month or two to make sure that diets for good health go back to high Thon priority. Then we'll advise them to revive the campaigns.</br>
Neeson:We can assume that middle-aged and older people are going to go back to their good habits soon enough. What interests us most at the moment is how young people have been affected and what influence that will have on their future. The youth market is one of our mary concerns.</br>
Sanchez:Reiji, you may know Pearson was commissioned to do a survey on post-crisis youth attitudes.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_03">L08-03</div>
Ohtaki:I've read it. The initial findings are quite intriguing. Many of the missing and dead in the World Trade Center collapse were bond traders, firefighters and restaurant workers in their 20s and 30s. From that moment the world changed for their whole generation.</br>
White:Their perceptions of the world are bound to be different. The survey indicates a real uncertainty about the future.</br>
Neeson:For the so-called Millennials born after 1982, this sense of vulnerability is entirely new. They never doubted that the United States was the world's only superpower.</br>
Sanchez:On the other hand, Generation Xers remember the Cold War and its nuclear nightmares, and they also saw their parents weather a heavy recession. Still, nothing has hit as close to home as this.</br>
White:Though both generations have a sense of optimism and community spirit in common, they share apathy toward the government. Most of them don't bother to vote in elections.</br>
Ohtaki:Another thing that caught my eye is more interest in foreign affairs. Americans are notorious for their lack of interest in the rest of the world.</br>
Neeson:They're going to find out how differently life is lived in distant countries. That should be a real eye-opener. Dately</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_04">L08-04</div>
Ohtaki:Are we also looking at a new generation of news consumers? According to the survey, there's been a record-breaking rise in TV news viewers and newspaper readers, largely in the 18 to 34 demographic</br>
White:Notice that they're accessing online news outlets, signing on for news flash services, and even scanning military magazine Web sites. What a turnaround from not paying much attention to what's going on in the outside world.</br>
Neeson:At the ripe old age of 32, I'm caught up in it too. I feel a deep need to know what's happening in Washington and the rest of the world. It's a real wake-up call for people in my age range.</br>
White:The upsurge in young readers is bringing in new revenue and could encourage advertisers to come back. Readers in their late teens to mid-30s make up a coveted market that was not easy to reach with conventional newspaper ads.</br>
Ohtaki:It's the same with evening TV news. The audience used to be mostly over 55 years old, not exactly the most lucrative demographic for advertisers. Now with all the young people tuning in, advertisers can connect with a much broader audience.</br>
White:As put it, we got our wake-up call. Things will continue to change and we will continue to rexamine our most important priorities in life.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_01">L09-01</div>
Peter Neeson:What a quiet Monday, with and Reiji at M&B for a confab and out doing a pitch to a prospect. It's just as well. I'm still recovering from the weekend Laugh Seminar.</br>
Minna Fisk:Me too, but it was a blast. You can always count on Pearson to try something new and different. I still don't know how on earth Haydn found out about laughter therapy. I laughed so hard I cried.</br>
Don Hopkins:I was skeptical at first. I've heard of alternative medicine, but laughter therapy? Please. I had my doubts when that laughter therapist started telling us that a big belly laugh is good for mental health, the immune system and blood pressure.</br>
Heidi Lyon:I raised an eye brow too, but when he went on to talk about how different kinds of healthful laughter could help to relieve pain and suffering, he was very convincing.</br>
Neeson:I had heard that laughter was able to help with inflammatory conditions like arthritis and gout by stimulating the brain to release endorphins or natural painkillers. My ears perked up when he said his seminars are very popular with teachers, nurses and physical therapists.</br>
Fisk:When you've got 40 people laughing nonstop, it's contagious. It was so hilarious, with people slapping their knees, totally out of control.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_02">L09-02</div>
Fisk:I plan to sign right up for the in-house Pearson Laughter Club that! is going to organize.</br>
Iris Hopkins:The therapist filled me in on the history of laughter therapy during the break. The whole notion of a Laughter Club started out in India as a form of yoga exercise. A local physician dreamed it up. He got his patients to do laughing exercises for 10 or 15 minutes a day and it worked like a charm. They felt better, and now there are hundreds of Laughter Clubs in India. The idea is catching on here in the U.S. and in Europe.</br>
Lyon:By the end of the seminar I felt so peaceful, so energized, and so connected to everyone else. I remembered something|Victor Borge once said: “Laughter is the shortest distance between two people." How true. We've all been so tense for the last nine months. Releasing all that stress is just what the doctor ordered.</br>
Neeson:On the other hand, laughter therapy isn't for everyone. It's a definite no-no for expectant mothers dealing with difficult pregnancies or hospital patients just coming off major surgery. Luckily, that included none of us.</br>
Fisk:His closing comments were fascinating. I had no idea that laughter was a subject for scientific study. Historical thinkers from Plato and Aristotle to Kant, Darwin and Freud have tried to fathom laughter, but they've been long on philosophy and short on science.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_03">L09-03</div>
Lyon:Yeah. Remember what he said about that group of neuroscientists who are using MRI brain scans and other techniques to do research on tickling?</br>
Hopkins:Oh, yeah. I've always wondered why I laugh if someone else tickles me, but not if I tickle my own ribs. I thought that experiment they tried on baby monkeys was interesting. Monkeys react to tickling, but they don't laugh the way we do. It comes out more like panting and gasps.</br>
Neeson:Good laughs are messages of goodwill that we share with each other. It's good for self-therapy too. It speeds up heartbeat much the same as jogging. It can ease pain and relieve discomfort. I think part of the reason our world felt so gloomy for months on end is that laughter had gone out of fashion.</br>
Fisk:Yeah. After 9/11 laughter took a back seat in our lives. If we tuned in to a TV late show, there were no wisecracks directed at the White House. Comedians were walking on eggshells for a while. They couldn't use their usual material because, in light of what happened at the World Trade Center, their customary targets for humor were the leaders of a country gearing up for a counterattack. It's hard to find humor in that.</br>
Hopkins:Stand-up comedians and humor writers couldn't figure o how to be humorous in a new and different way.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_04">L09-04</div>
Fisk:The rules did change. You couldn't do jokes spoofing national leaders, military activities or the airlines. As one TV comedian put it, when times are good, you make fun of the good guys. When times are bad, you make fun of the bad guys.</br>
Hopkins:TV comedians do have one direct benefit. If they say some thing in poor taste, they get an immediate audience reaction, and can shelve that topic right away. It's much tougher for the humor writers who do scripts for movies or TV series. They don't know what to rule out because they don't have that fast feedback. I think a lot of them will continue to play it safe and we'll be seeing escapist comedies on movie screens for a while.</br>
Neeson:Let's not be too sensitive. Good comedy should be provocative as well as humorous. It's one of the best ways to weigh the pros and cons of controversial social issues. It's been used in that way ever since the comedies of ancient Greece. Even in those days, half the audience cheered and the other half jeered, but at least the issue was out in the open, not behind closed doors. </br>
Fisk:A good comedian does more than just crack jokes. He or she digs into what's going on and puts a spotlight on it. Some people may hate humor on thorny subjects. Other people love it, whatever their stand on the issue. People with a real sense of humor know what a good gift it is to laugh their cares away.</br>

Heidi Lyon:Welcome back, Hiram. How did it go in Minneapolis?</br>
Hiram White:The meetings went well, but I was dismayed by what I heard about the Mall of America.</br>
Anita Sanchez:Isn't that the city's biggest visitor attraction? I went there a couple of years ago and remember seeing busloads of shoppers coming in from all over the region. Has it suffered the same shoppers' drop-off that has plagued so many other malls in the past few months?</br>
White:I'm afraid so. It used to draw nearly a million people a week, but those days are over. In Minneapolis, business travel has plummeted by 60 percent due to the airline crisis, and the city's biggest employer perc had to lay off 4,000 employees last fall. People are worried about their jobs, and consumer spending is down as a result.</br>
Lyon:What a downfall. In the '90s Minneapolis was rated the best place to live in the United States. It was No.1 in job growth and household income.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:From what I've heard, fear of job loss is one of the main reasons that American families are pinching pennies. Another reason is that they don't feel safe in malls, especially mega-malls which may seem to be tempting targets for terrorists.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_02">L10-02</div>
Sanchez:In general, though, last fall set off a disaster for most retailers. All of a sudden, American shopaholics stopped buying and flying, and started tightening their purse strings. That's why we've seen retailers resorting to massive markdowns or haggling with customers who insist on lower prices. Look at the huge discounts on airfares.</br>
White:In spite of all that, consumers are holding out for even better deals. Drastic cuts in airfares are bringing passenger numbers gradually up to full capacity, but in the long run how are the airlines going to cover the costs of huge discounts?</br>
Lyon:The airlines aren't the only ones worried about the bottom line. How is Detroit going to repay the loans needed to cover zero-interest financing for car buyers? The campaign last fall was a great success. Something like 1.7 million new cars and trucks were snapped up last October alone. Now, though, the feeding frenzy seems to be over.</br>
Ohtaki:By all reports, the Christmas season was disappointing for department stores, toy stores and other retailers. My next-door neighbors told me they waited until right before Christmas to do their shopping so they could take advantage of discounts of 40 to 50 percent.</br>
Sanchez:I did all of my shopping without setting foot outside.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_03">L10-03</div>
Sanchez:Online stores bombarded me with offers of free shipping and 70 percent discounts, and I made out like a bandit. said she skipped the local mall and went straight to one of the major discount chain stores. She saved a small fortune, as did millions of other costconscious shoppers. That particular discount chain made a whopping profit on Christmas business.</br>
Minna White:As well it should. Major discount chains have helped lower our cost of living for the past ten years. I love a bargain as much as the next guy, but at the same time, I realize that fat discounts cutting into skinny profit margins will force countless mom-and-pop stores out of business and into bankruptcy.</br>
Sanchez:Highnd stores that sell luxury goods are in dire straits too. People aren't forking out for status symbols like $60,000 diamond earrings anymore. Rich people are still big spenders, but are more conservative now. They're spending more on their homes and families.</br>
Ohtaki:I'd say their priorities have changed and they're getting back to basics. For all of us the highest priorities are food and shelter, fol. lowed by safety and security. Instead of buying fabulous designer Fer clothes and jewelry, highnd consumers are purchasing expensive home security systems.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_04">L10-04</div>
White:The economic downturn and end of spending sprees are bad enough, but for malls, the problem is compounded by fear of terrorist mayhem</br>
Sanchez:Mall managers are struggling to tighten security, but there is only so much they can do. They can't treat all of their customers as potential terrorists and subject them to random body searches. About all they can do is stay on high alert during business hours, but that won't screen out a specialist with a bomb in a backpack.</br>
Ohtaki:You're right, Anita. Mall security probably can't forestall an expert attack. Even so, my local mall has introduced some security measures like parking restrictions. No overnight parking is allowed, and delivery vans are carefully inspected for concealed car bombs. Cooperative ties with the local police and emergency response teams are much tighter, and I've seen more security guards on duty than in the past.</br>
Lyon:That may seem like a good sign to you and me, but seeing more guards in the mall may make some people feel even more afraid of a possible attack. That alone can scare off regular customers. And what more can a mall manager do in the real world?  You can't turn a mall into a quasi-military base with guard towers, sentries and metal detectors.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_01">L11-01</div>
Iris Haydn:Hi, guys. Peter, Reiji, let me introduce you to my friend, Bess Hefner. Bess used to work here at Pearson, but now she's a freelance telecommuter. Pearson is just one of her many clients.</br>
Peter Neeson:Pleased to meet you, Bess. So, what made you decide to telecommute? Bess Hefner: Well, I used to have a terrible commute from New Haven that ate up two hours a day on the train, plus another half-hour to drive to and from the station. I was worn out by the time I got to the office. I wanted to make better use of that time, so I decided to look into working from home.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:That's about the same for me. My bus ride from New Jersey takes over an hour each way. I read that New Yorkers have the longest commute of any U.S. city at an average of nearly 40 minutes. I think Chicago was next at 33 minutes.</br>
Neeson:I'd love to walk to work, but it takes me an hour and 15 minutes on the train from Queens, with two transfers, so that's not an option. You would think that New York commutes would be quicker because of our extensive transit system.</br>
Ohtaki:In Tokyo and Osaka, a two-hour commute from a bedroom community to a downtown office is not unusual. Most people have to stand the whole way on jam-packed trains, so for me, one hour on a bus is nothing. More often than not, I doze off in my seat.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_02">L11-02</div>
Haydn:Some of us tried carpooling for a short time around here, but it would take a miracle to alleviate Manhattan traffic jams. Subways are still the fastest way to get around in New York. Carpooling is popular in California, thanks to the special carpool lanes on the freeways. Some major employers even use special incentives to encourage their employees to carpool.</br>
Neeson:A friend of mine told me that carpoolers who commute to San Francisco across the Bay Bridge can cross twice as fast in a special lane, and they don't have to pay the $2 bridge toll. If you don't have the minimum number of people in your car, you can pull over at casual carpooling places where people line up for a ride.</br>
Hefner: Right now there's another reason for telecommuting. It was beginning to lose its appeal after a brief burst of popularity, but in the wake of 9/11, companies have realized that it's wise to have the workforce dispersed instead of all packed together in one location.</br>
Ohtaki:Yes, that is a good idea. told us that Pearson is holding the door open for wannabe telecommuters.</br>
Iris Neeson:It's not without complications, but new arrangements are under way to protect network security. Telecommuters will be armed with smart cards, secure IDs and safeguarded software programs.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_03">L11-03</div>
Haydn:I've had several requests from employees interested in telecommuting. Many see working at home as a way of reducing stress.</br>
Ohtaki:It can also save costs for companies by cutting back on business travel, especially time wasted on long waits at airports. All in all, it's more attractive to all concerned to have a certain percentage of workers safe and sound at home.</br>
Neeson:A staff that's less centralized is one way for a company to protect its human resources. With the renewed interest in telecommuting, consultants for communication systems and software sure aren't hurting for work. Companies are turning to them to provide seamless phone and video systems for workers spread out all over the map.</br>
Haydn:At any rate, the age of face time seems to be going the way of the dinosaurs. It used to be critical to be seen and heard in person if you wanted to get ahead in a company. Otherwise it was "out of sight, out of mind."</br>
Neeson:That's still important in some companies, but things have been changing with the growing numbers of telecommuters who rarely communicate face-to-face with their supervisors. On the other hand, how can you stay "visible" without actual face time?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_04">L11-04</div>
Hefner: I keep in touch with clients through e-mail and phone calls. Once in a while we meet for lunch and I pick up the tab. The constant feedback I provide and my willingness to go the extra mile have gotten me several referrals from satisfied clients.</br>
Ohtaki:How did you get started? I would think it would be difficult to jump right in. What could you offer that would convince people to use you? Did you have special skills that made you stand out?</br>
Haydn:I can answer that. Bess is a specialist in designing information kits for financial services - banks, stockbrokers, and so forth. Lee Seymour's husband, Barry, was one of her first clients. Through him me she won referrals to other new clients in financial circles. Word spread, and her client list grew. ar</br>
Neeson:I get it. Bess, I don't suppose a lot of other telecommuters can offer what you can. You've created a niche market that keeps you in high demand. Hefner: Yes, my clients need me because my service is unique. That's what I sold them on from the very beginning. Now I'm well known in the financial industry. I network with other freelance telecommuters and I can tell you that those who are most successful are similar to me. Their focus may be narrow but their service is unique and highly specialized.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_01">L12-01</div>
Heidi Lyon:How was your flight from Atlanta, Don? Were there a lot of empty seats?</br>
Don Hopkins:No such luck. I was hoping to lie down across three seats and catch some sleep, but fate was not in my corner. Apparently most business travelers are still flying, so my hopes for a nap were dashed. Word on board had it that most domestic flights were at twothirds capacity.</br>
Minna Fisk:After all the bad news about massive airline layoffs and government-financed bailouts, flying on business has made a comeback. International carriers are seeing load factors of three-quarters of seat capacity. I read that overall figures are four percent lower than last year, but that's due to the world economic slowdown rather than fear of flying.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Even with a high load factor, the profit margin for airlines is paper-thin. A four percent drop is no drop in the bucket. Two years ago, international carriers posted a net profit of well over $4.5 billion on the whole. Last year that four percent dip landed them more than $10 billion in the red.</br>
Lyon:When you consider the big discounts that airlines are offering to lure passengers back on board, it's no wonder they're hurting in terms of net revenues. The small numbers of passengers who are frightened to fly aren't tempted by dirt cheap fares.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_02">L12-02</div>
Lyon:Hardened business travelers snap up those tickets instead of paying through the nose for standard businessand first-class fares.</br>
Hopkins:It's easy to get 10 to 25 percent off the regular fare if you use airline discounters, and it's even cheaper if you buy a ticket on the Web. Business-class fares are at the forefront of the discounts and that's good news for businesses looking to cut costs. On the flip side, airline accountants must be pulling their hair out over plunging revenues.</br>
Fisk:I doubt that airlines can expect rising profit margins anytime soon. As it is, many business travelers are asking themselves if it's all that necessary to fly when they could be using telephone or video conferences to negotiate business deals.</br>
Ohtaki:Half-measures like that might cement an easy deal but won't succeed with difficult customers, the kind of people you need to meet face-to-face to dot the i's and cross the t's of a contract. That could make or break a deal.</br>
Lyon:I'd say is with you on that. He is still wary of flying, but he knows when he has to grit his teeth and book a flight. However, he is canny about the flight to go for. For the shortest wait at the airport, he books the first flight of the day to where he's headed. If it's a domestic flight, he arrives at the airport two hours in advance.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_03">L12-03</div>
Hiram Lyon:For an international flight he gets there three hours ahead of departure time.</br>
Hopkins:That's right in line with what most airlines advise, but it's not gospel. Some airports have their own guidelines. If in doubt, I phone the airline and then have a look-see at the airport's Web site. And remember that experience is the best teacher. When I fly back here from Kansas City, I figure 40 minutes to one hour is ample time to check in, grab my boarding pass, and go through security. Even with the extra security measures, I've never missed a flight.</br>
Fisk:I keep my baggage as light as possible to minimize time for baggage checks and to avoid going over the weight limit. Airlines are very strict on baggage limits on both domestic and international flights. I wear a conservative outfit that doesn't draw suspicion from security officials. Still, you never know when your name will pop up for a random security check, so it doesn't hurt to build some extra time into your schedule.</br>
Ohtaki:That's for sure. I've certainly had my share of delays. I pack an overnight kit in my carry-on luggage so that I can shave or change my clothes in case I'm stranded.</br>
Fisk:If you're stranded or facing a long delay, and airport phone booths are mobbed, there's a great way to stay in touch with your family or colleagues.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_04">L12-04</div>
Fisk:I set up a Web-based e-mail account that I can access from anywhere in the world. It's free and you can set up your account instantly.</br>
Ohtaki:Before I head for the airport, I do a last-minute check of my airline's Web site for info on the status of my flight. Web sites for most airlines also list hotlines you can call for the latest information.</br>
Lyon:It's also good to know that if a flight is delayed or cancelled altogether, many airlines will put passengers on other flights with no penalty, even if you have a discount ticket.</br>
Hopkins:I keep my cell phone with a spare battery in my suit jacket in case the pilot announces a flight diversion. That's another way to keep people up-to-date on what's going on. By the way, what do you think of that new program to put air marshals on flights?</br>
Ohtaki:I'm all for it. It may be expensive to hire thousands of air marshals, but it's worth every penny to stay safe and sound while we're in the air.</br>
Lyon:I feel safe enough on commercial flights with the additional security safeguards already in place, but it is nice to know that more air marshals will be looking after me in the near future. I'll be even happier when airport waiting times drop back down to normal.</br>

Sanchez:I phoned Amy Sage at Andy's Candies six or seven times yesterday to confirm our next meeting. She didn't call back, so this morning I e-mailed instead and asked why. I guess my e-mail rubbed her the wrong way, because she wrote back saying she was offended by my message. Naturally, I'll call and apologize, but I can't understand why she's so upset.</br>
Hiram White:Maybe the way you worded the message struck her as rude, despite your intentions. We all appreciate the speed and efficiency of e-mail, but sometimes we click "send" too soon. A hastily written message may come off as brusque and could lead to a misunderstanding with a client or colleague.</br>
Heidi Lyon:I think we've all been there. Look at it this way. When you and I talk face-to-face, we pick up on the vocal cues, body language and facial expressions that indicate our true feelings. E-mail doesn't allow for that.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Exactly. We can soften a sharp remark with a wink or a smile, but that same message might seem curt or downright rude onscreen. When I write e-mail, I word it carefully so that a warm and cordial tone comes through. That way, it won't cause misunderstandings at the other end.</br>
Sanchez:That's what we do when we send regular business letters.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L13_02">L13-02</div>
Sanchez:We set the right tone by showing respect through greetings or expressions such as "Dear Sir" or "Most sincerely." E-mail falls somewhere in between a business letter and a conversation, and as a result, messages might be interpreted as disrespectful.</br>
White:There are ways to add tone and feeling in e-mail. My kids some times sign off "LOL" for "laughing out loud." They also love to use "emoticons," like happy or sad faces to show their feelings. Emoticons strike me as too playful for business e-mail, but we need to devise some dignified forms of expression that are both friendly and respectful.</br>
Lyon:Taking away the face-to-face element can also make people feel less inhibited. My former boss used to stay in touch with a business partner in Australia through e-mail. One day his partner blew up in response to what my boss thought was an innocuous message. He thought he had written a witty e-mail, but somehow came across as cranky and sarcastic. He certainly wouldn't have used that tone of voice in person. The dispute was in danger of boiling over, so he flew to Adelaide to patch things up with his partner.</br>
Ohtaki:It's much easier to work things out in person. Sometimes a simple pat on the back or an understanding look can defuse a conflict. Sadly, you can't do that in e-mail.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L13_03">L13-03</div>
Sanchez:It looks like I'll have to watch the way I write e-mail from now on. I can't blame Amy Sage for feeling miffed because I might have implied that she was unprofessional.</br>
White:That's not the only problem we're facing with e-mail. Who could forget that incident last month when those hackers disrupted our e-mail system? No major damage was done, but it was a big nuisance.</br>
Ohtaki:I remember how happy I was when e-mail became popular. It was nice not to have to send faxes or cables all of the time. Now I'm not as thrilled. I get at least 50 e-mail messages a day. Some are workrelated, others are personal messages or jokes from friends, and the rest is junk mail. I worry that some of the messages might be carrying a virus ready to zap my hard drive.</br>
Sanchez:Usually I can spot junk mail at a glance and delete it. Then I go through what's left. Way back when, that might have taken 10 or 15 minutes, but nowadays, it can eat up an hour of a typical working day. E-mail is convenient, but it's also a growing burden.</br>
White:E-mail seems urgent. I feel as though if I don't read it and reply right away, I might forget to do so and have it come back to haunt me. Sometimes I need to pay prompt attention to important snail mail, but I don't until I've dealt with all the e-mail.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L13_04">L13-04</div>
Lyon:It's a global headache. Every single day more than six billion email messages are sent around the world. That figure will continue to escalate and there's no escape. People check their cell phones on street corners or plug in their laptops on airplanes to read e-mail. With technology providing instant access, they feel they need to stay connected all the time.</br>
Ohtaki:They may feel frantic if incoming e-mail is cut off for some reason. That can happen if there's a dispute between two network providers who have a peering agreement to exchange e-mail traffic with each other cost-free. If their connection is severed, some businesses will suffer. Their e-mail won't be delivered and they won't be able to access their Web sites.</br>
White:In view of the anthrax scare, e-mail is faring better than ever. Snail mail is not only slow anymore; it may be hazardous to your health. I sometimes wonder why we need paper mail at all.</br>
Ohtaki:E-commerce isn't viable without some degree of dependence on paper. On the other hand, I don't want to feel queasy whenever I open an envelope. A world without paper seems ideal. Certainly, it would put an end to plundering the planet's forests, or what's left of them. E-mail is here to stay, but I still don't foresee paper going away for quite a while.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L14_01">L14-01</div>
Minna Fisk:This is a fine backgrounder, Reiji. I take it that you and Joan Slocum had a lot to talk about.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Yes. As the resident nutrition expert over at Vale, she knows her stuff. She told me that several federal government agencies and health organizations have banded together to urge children to eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day for a balanced diet. As the largest U.S. supplier of fresh produce, Vale agreed to spearhead a public service campaign.</br>
Anita Sanchez:I can see why. More kids eating more fruits and veggies means more business for Vale. They're fighting an uphill battle, though, given that over 90 percent of Saturday morning TV commercials aimed at children promote junk food.</br>
Don Hopkins:There's pressure from Washington on broadcasters and advertisers to do more programming or run public service announcements that encourage kids to eat more healthfully.</br>
Fisk:The Surgeon General has said that smoking, heavy boozing and a bad diet are the three leading causes of poor health in adults. Two577. thirds of us die from a poor diet that leads to heart disease, strokes. diabetes and cancer. It says right here that about 35 percent of us die from cancer that is linked with typical American food and drinl. Maybe I should add that a typical British diet isn't much different.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L14_02">L14-02</div>
Ohtaki:A diet high in fat and cholesterol and low in ruits bles not only heightens our risk of disease, but it also leads to obesity. ned a campaign for Vale that emphasizes the nutritional bene fits of fruits and vegetables, poel</br>
Sanchez:Good idea. First off, let's look at beta-carotene. Our bodies use it to make vitamin A. I see we have beta-carotene in veggies that have dark green leaves, including spinach, kale, and romaine lettuce. It's also found in orange or yellow foods such as squash, cantaloupe, carrots, apricots and sweet potatoes.</br>
Hopkins:We've got vitamin C in tomatoes, cabbage, and cauliflower in addition to citrus fruits. We need vitamin C for healthy bones and teeth, tendons and blood vessels. It helps our bodies heal wounds. absorb iron and fight infection. It may even protect us against some cancers, cataracts and hardening of the arteries.</br>
Fisk:Vitamin A is also a major player for healthy teeth, hair and bones. It fights infection and gives us good vision. In fact, we can go blind if we don't take in enough vitamin A. Moving on, why do we need fiber? We digest what we need and fiber speeds what's left out of our bowThat in turn cuts down on the time our bowels are exposed to car cinogens.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L14_03">L14-03</div>
Ohtaki:Tnat's important input for adults, but it won't have any impact on children. What can we do to get kids interested and excited about eating fruits and veggies five times a day?</br>
Sanchez:Joan points out here that American adults and children on average, eat only half that number of servings in a day. In fact, only 10 percent of us eat five servings. I'd say our goal is to convince kids that iruits and veggies taste so good that they want to gobble them up.</br>
Hopkins:That could be a tall order, but it can be done. When I was a kid, broccoli and cauliflower were not on my list of favorite foods, but my mother found a way to get around that by adding them to her tasty chicken soup. I grew up eating those two veggies that way, but would it work with kids today?</br>
Fisk:We can solve those problems as we move along. Right now we need to sketch out the elements of the program. Suppose we come up with a series of public service announcements for Saturday morning TV. Of course, we'll consider children's interests and speak to them in their language. What I have in mind is a set of animated PSAs with a cartoon kid who acts as a spokesperson and introduces various fruite and vegetables as fun playmates. We'll need lots of fast-paced action for high impact.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L14_04">L14-04</div>
Ohtaki:Sounds good to me. However, I think we need to include a brochure aimed at parents and teachers. It could be distributed schools, pediatricians' offices and supermarkets. How about tours of produce departments at supermarkets to teach schoolchildren about fruits and vegetables?</br>
Sanchez:I like it. As said, his mother made simple veggie soups that he liked. Things like that could go into a cookbook that's fun to look at, using the same cartoon characters that appear in the PSAs. We can teach kids how to wash and prepare fruits and veggies with simple step-by-step recipes and pictures. We can also teach kids and parents how to combine fruits and veggies with foods they already like. How about sliced kiwi on ice cream or celery sticks coated with melted cheese for starters?</br>
Don Hopkins:One of my childhood breakfast favorites was a fruit juice shake made with bananas, pineapple juice, strawberries and vanilla yogurt all whipped together in a blender. For lunch I could never turn down a sandwich made with tuna, chopped apples, mustard, honey and lettuce. Another old favorite was carrot and raisin salad.</br>
Sanchez:In my house, unpopular veggies were covered with sauce or chopped into little bits to go into a soup. Another of my mother's tactics was arranging carrot sticks topped with broccoli to look like little trees on a small dish.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L15_01">L15-01</div>
Heidi Lyon:Good morning, Reiji. What brings you to work this early?</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:I need to finish some paperwork for the children's nutri tion program before I meet Joan at 10 o'clock. I'm surprised to see all three of you already here. Is there a crisis?</br>
Minna Fisk:No. We're early birds. We're full of pep this early in the morning, so we can get a heap of work done before everyone else rolls in.</br>
Hiram White:I don't advertise the fact that I'm here so early, so I'm not By interrupted by phone calls or people popping in to chat about something or other. Once the day officially begins, I've got meetings and so on that eat up most of my time. One reason I come in early is to get organized for the day's workload.</br>
Lyon:The same goes for me. and I put our heads together and preview what's on his schedule. How a manager deals with his day-to-day time is a hallmark of his managerial skills. Sometimes it's a juggling act, but prioritizing helps keep those balls in the air schedule on</br>
Hiram White:That's the truth. As soon as and I have set my day's agenda. I go through memos and reports in my in-box, check my e-mail and respond if required, and then prep for my first meeting.</br>
Heidi Fisk:My early morning huddle with is a good chance to update each other on projects in progress.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L15_02">L15-02</div>
Hiram Fisk:Both of us pick up bits of information from people we've talked to the day before. It's often surprising how much useful information can be garnered from informal chats on the phone or face-to-face. Just yesterday Lee Seymour called and mentioned offhand that Bea Keaton at Nelsonex will ask for some text modifications in the "What's Cooking?" kit. I asked her for specifics so that I'll be ready with a quick response when Bea calls.</br>
Ohtaki:I see what you mean. Timely information helps keep schedules running smoothly. I don't have Hiram's responsibilities as a group manager, but I have to find ways to save time too. That's why I'm here this early. I have two more meetings after my meeting with Joan, and no time to prepare for them in between. I'm not an early bird by nature, maybe more of a night owl. After the kids have gone to bed, the house quiets down, and I'll often stay up and burn the midnight oil.</br>
Lyon:Working at night is not for me. I'm usually in bed by 10, and the moment my head sinks into the pillow, I'm out like a light. People have different biorhythms. I know mine. An early bird I may be, but never a night owl. I've learned to follow my nature when it comes to managing my time.</br>
White:I have too.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L15_03">L15-03</div>
White:During the course of a day, if I can get away from my desk for a half-hour or so, I'm inclined to go on a walkabout. I'll visit my fellow managers for five-minute chats that occasionally stretch to half an hour. That may seem to be a waste of time, but usually it's not. I'm amazed at the nuggets of information I can pick up that way.</br>
Fisk:Like Hiram, I'm not fond of formal meetings. They take up so much of our time, Casual conversations with key people can be more rewarding. On the other hand, an efficiently organized and structured meeting can give us a bumper crop of information. A good meeting keeps us focused on the main objective and allows us to make on-the-spot decisions. It's time management at its best.</br>
Ohtaki:That's why I look forward to meetings with Joan or Sue Ellen at Nelsonex. Sure, we enjoy a bit of personal chitchat before we get down to business, but once we shift into high gear, not a moment is wasted. That's why I have to be so well prepared with ideas, questions or points for discussion.</br>
Lyon:That's the norm in successful companies. There's no time to waste in a working day. The higher your position, the more relentless demands on your time.</br>
Ohtaki:In my former company, we had a department manager who scheduled a staff meeting once a week, without fail.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L15_04">L15-04</div>
Ohtaki:Most of the time, we just sat there while he pontificated on subjects he didn't know much about. I remember one lecture on how to think creatively. We didn't know whether to laugh or cry, since his! version of creativity was taking credit for our bright ideas. If someone asked a question, he beat around the bush because he didn't know the answer. The one question we all wanted to ask was why we were wasting our time in those meetings.</br>
Fisk:One of my pet peeves is being stuck with a chatterbox in the seat next to me on an airplane. I don't mind some small talk, but after five V minutes I usually cut them off with, "Nice talking to you, but excuse me, I have work to do." A quiet ride in the air is prime time to get cracking on what's coming up in Taipei or Tokyo. As much as I'd love to just kick back with a magazine, my first priority is to be able to hit the ground running when I land. My business trips are always scheduled to the hilt, so I've got to make the most of my flight time.</br>
White:I don't know about you, but my weekends often seem as hectic as my weekdays. Apart from what goes on here at Pearson, I'm 7 involved in a lot of community activities. My wife and I always talk things over to make sure we don't spread ourselves too thin. It's rtant to have some time to relax and recharge before the new week begins.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L16_01">L16-01</div>
Don Hopkins:I had a close call over the weekend. on the highway to Lake Placid. I heard a strange noise, so I pulled over to the shoulder to have a look under the hood. The radiator was hissing. Its water had hit boiling point. I had no spare water in the trunk, so I called for help on my cell phone.</br>
Anita Sanchez:It was a good thing you had a cell phone. I worry, because I sometimes forget to carry one.</br>
Hopkins:In that case, you could always keep a "Call Police" sign in your car to prop up against the window. Some Good Samaritan is bound to make the call on your behalf.</br>
Sanchez:Oh, that's a good idea. Thanks.</br>
Hopkins:Anyway, half an hour later a tow truck arrived. The driver looked at the radiator, shook his head, and said I was lucky it hadn't exploded. He gingerly took the cap off and filled the radiator with cold water. I waited another half-hour after he left for it to cool down more before I hit the road again.</br>
Iris Haydn:But don't you look at your gauges on the instrument panel? You could have seen that the radiator had overheated. When I drive. I glance at the gauges every now and then to keep an eye on the engine temperature, fuel and oil readings. Of course, if your car atau to shake, instruments can't tell you what's wrong. In that case. I would slow down, pull over, and check the tires.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L16_02">L16-02</div>
Ohtaki Reiji:A flat tire I can fix, but steering or braking trouble is much more serious. I pull over immediately and call the professionals. If I'm only dealing with a blown fuse or a low-pressure tire, though, I'll slow down gradually and keep on moving to the nearest service station.</br>
Haydn:I make sure that I don't stop on a soft shoulder, a curb or a curve that drivers behind me can't see easily. You can never be too ley careful. I read recently that nearly 3,000 people die in car accidents that happen on road shoulders and medians each year. Even if I'm parked, I could be sideswiped. If I've got a flat tire, I usually choose to slow down and look for a safe place. That might damage the tire rim, but I'd rather risk that than risk my life.</br>
Sanchez:If there's no sign of smoke or fire, I stay in the car with the windows closed and the door locked, and wait for help to arrive. I keep my seat belt tight just in case my car is rammed in the rear by a careless driver. If somebody who looks suspicious comes up to the car, I don't open the door. I may crack the window just a bit to say the police are coming. That does the trick.</br>
Ohtaki:In my glove compartment I have emergency phone numbers, a flashlight, my car registration, insurance papers and a copy of my health insurance card. Believe me, all of that can come in handy.</br>
Haydn:I do the same.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L16_03">L16-03</div>
Haydn:I also keep a fire extinguisher in my trunk, along with reflectors. a jack, a lug wrench, jumper cables and a spare tire.</br>
Ohtaki:I also take a look at the oil level and check for oil leaks once a week. Every 3,000 miles I change the oil. I give all four tires a onceover in case there may be nails or stones caught in the treads.</br>
Haydn:If I drive to the local supermarket after dark, I'm doubly careful about how and where I park. If possible, I back into a parking space so I can scoot out in a hurry if necessary. I park as close to the store's entrance as I can, so I'm in bright light and not out in the open alone for more than a minute. When I get to the car, I circle it and take a quick peek underneath. My neighborhood is safe, but you never know when a mugger might come to town.</br>
Hopkins:I'm cautious in parking garages. Ideally, I prefer spaces close to the parking attendant. If that's not possible, I park as close as I can to the elevator or the entrance stairs.</br>
Sanchez:Me too. I'm also worried about carjacking. According to the FBI, 25,000 cars are hijacked in this country every year. I keep my doors locked all the time, and I keep an eye on people at intersections when I stop at a red light.</br>
Ohtaki:If I'm in the driver's seat on a family outing, my wife navigates.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L16_04">L16-04</div>
Ohtaki:She reads the maps, changes the radio stations and punches in the phone number when I need to make a call.</br>
Haydn:When you're at the wheel, you should do whatever it takes to keep from being distracted. Distractions such as fiddling with the car stereo or chatting on a cell phone cause one out of every four motor vehicle crashes. That adds up to 4,300 accidents every day of the year. I keep my hands off dashboard controls unless I have to turn on headlights.</br>
Hopkins:Dashboard dining is tisky too. I'll stop at a drive-in for fast food if I'm hungry, but I don't eat it while I'm driving.</br>
Sanchez:Other passengers can be a distraction too, especially hyperactive kids in the back seat. Friends of mine who have to deal with that keep the kids' seatbelts buckled and give them books or games to keep them quiet.</br>
Hopkins:That's always a good idea. Say, what's your take on all this talk about keeping headlights on during the day? Just anore xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</br>
Sanchez:Those in favor claim that daytime running lights are just another safety precaution. Those who don't agree tend to say that it's just one more example of marketing hype by automakers. Mind you. some countries require cars to have daytime running lights. In this country, the issue is still up in the air. For the moment, I'm not voting either way. I'll sit back and see how it pans out.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L17_01">L17-01</div>
Peter Neeson:Iris, this report that you compiled from the last census has fascinating statistics on marriage and families. I had no idea that one-quarter of all families are single-mother families. That's double the figure for 1970.</br>
Minna Fisk:I'm staggered by the sharp hike in single-father homes. Apparently, families and courts are more inclined nowadays to conclude that life with Dad can be a better deal for the children.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Even so, Minna, single-father households account for only two percent of all households. People used to think that single dads wouldn't care for kids as well as moms would. That's why divorced fathers rarely won custody battles. It looks like things have changed."</br>
Iris Haydn:There's a new perception that single fathers can be counted on to take good care of their kids. Soaring numbers of single dads have given rise to a quiet revolution in family values. In the latter half of the 20th century, women chose to go into the workplace in big numbers. In the 21st century, it appears that men are embracing the role of homemaker as well as breadwinner.</br>
Fisk:was a single father for several years. He's quite open about it. His former wife had an offer to move up the corporate ladder with a new position in Berlin.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L17_02">L17-02</div>
Hiram Fisk:She took it and told him point-blank that she couldn't possibly con tend with her new position and the task of bringing up kids in a foreign country. filed for divorce. She didn't contest it. The kids voted to stick with him and the court supported their choice. A few years later he remarried, and now has six kids in all, including three from his current wife's previous marriage.</br>
Hiram Neeson:He told us once that the scariest time of his life was the first 24 hours after his wife walked out. He was worried he wouldn't be able to fill both roles as father and mother.</br>
Ohtaki:I know what would happen in Japan. A single father would cause tongues to wag in most neighborhoods. The local gossips would speculate that his wife ran away because he's difficult.</br>
Fisk:That could happen here too. Some single fathers feel the need to prove to others that they can be good parents, so they go the extra mile to stand out in some way.</br>
Neeson:In those situations, mothers may still be in the picture. They may have ceded custody of the kids, but they keep in touch with the kids as much as possible, just as dads would if the situation were reversed. It's not only a matter of single dads who want to be closer to their children. Some women just don't want to be tied down.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L17_03">L17-03</div>
Haydn:Bear in mind that a working mom who lets her ex have custody of the kids may pay child support. Hiram's wife did that until he remarried and let her know the money wasn't needed. She still sends birthday and Christmas gifts and she visits when she is on vacation stateside. She has also flown the kids to visit her in Berlin. Hiram's second wife works at home as an upscale seamstress for wealthy women, so they have a combined six-figure income.</br>
Ohtaki:OK, but I note here that less than 40 percent of single dads receive child support from their ex-wives, whereas 60 percent of single moms get a monthly check from dear old dad. The yearly average, however, is about the same at $3,300, according to the census. How far can a single parent stretch that to support a household? </br>
Fisk:Well, it's not all that much, but much better than nothing. Think of the 40 percent of single moms or 60 percent of single dads who don't get a red cent for child support. In many of those cases, you'd better believe they're barely eking out a living.</br>
Haydn:Yes, there is a trend for dads to spend more time at home, but it's not an easy decision to make. They still see themselves as the providers they were brought up to be.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L17_04">L17-04</div>
Haydn:When considering how to balance work and family, they agonize about losing opportunities for career advancement. Of course, that's nothing new for working moms.</br>
Ohtaki:I can see there's a trend, but it's mainly among younger fathers between 20 and 39 years old. They say that family matters more than salary and job security.</br>
Fisk:As the next generation of young men marries, we'll see even more of them tending to center their lives around their children. I laid down the law when my beau proposed marriage. I told him that I didn't want our future kids to grow up with an absentee dad. We had a long talk, and in the end he said he wanted the same thing. We both grew up with fathers who spent more time at the office than at home, and we want our kids to be equally close to both of us.</br>
Neeson:I had a similar discussion with my bride-to-be not too long ago, and I made the same decision your fiance did. I was lucky to have grown up with a very involved dad, and consider him to have been a great role model. I certainly wouldn't want to wake up one morning 20 years down the road and realize I hardly know my kids. Count me in as a member of the new trend.</br>
Haydn:Bravo, Peter. After all, someone once said that no one ever dies wishing they had spent more time at the office.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L18_01">L18-01</div>
Hiram White:Reiji, thanks for circulating this first draft of the Nelsonex position paper on its low-fat product line.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Actually, Sue Ellen Metz deserves our thanks. She thought we had a need to know, because low-fat foods have been an important part of our Nelsonex campaigns.</br>
Anita Sanchez:Sue Ellen's margin notes tell us that she will need to adjust a few of the recipes for the "What's Cooking?" cookbook to reflect the expected Nelsonex decision to phase out a lot of its low-fat food and drink products. According to the figures I see here, consumer interest in low-fat or no-fat product lines has really dropped over the years.</br>
Heidi Lyon:Back in the mid-90s, people were waging consumer warfare against fat. The national war cry was "down with fat, calories and cholesterol." Now it seems the pendulum has swung to the opposite extreme.</br>
White:I've seen very few low-fat products in my local stores in the last year or two. Fat is making a comeback. With certain products, more fat definitely means more flavor and better taste. Nelsonex's sales figures reflect that. Its sales of fat-free ice cream have dipped 15 percent in the past year alone.</br>
Sanchez:And all this started long before terrorists turned our lives inside out.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L18_02">L18-02</div>
Sanchez:I guess Americans want more flavor, more taste and more fat. I suspect that Nelsonex is not the only food giant to wake up and smell the coffee. I've seen a new line of full-fat potato chips at the supermarket.</br>
Lyon:I can see why. I tried quite a few of the lowor no-fat products yogurt, ice cream, potato chips, what have you-and to me, they all tasted awful. Food with an average amount of fat not only tastes better, but is cheaper to boot. The more fat you take out of a product, the worse it tastes and the more it costs to make it fat-free in the first place.</br>
White:That's the general consensus in my household. But apart from fat being back in favor, we've seen another taste shift away from highon end restaurants. Fine dining has fallen out of favor and the chefs at haute cuisine dining spots are hurting something fierce.)</br>
Sanchez:A lot of people have lost their lust for escargot and chateaubriand as culinary favorites even on special occasions. The trend is more towards old home-cooked favorites like fried shrimp and meatloaf with mashed potatoes. Neighborhood eateries that cater to that homey change in taste are making money hand over fist.</br>
Ohtaki:One reason for the trend is the economic downturn.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L18_03">L18-03</div>
Sanchez:Cities that count heavily on the tourist trade are also hurting. Restaurant owners in Miami, Washington, Honolulu and Las Vegas are wringing their hands as customer numbers continue to tumble.</br>
Lyon:Highnd restaurants may be suffering most, but on the whole we're eating out less often and spending less when we do. Even if we do go to a high-priced restaurant once in a while, luxuries like truffles, foie gras and premium champagne are out of the question.</br>
White:Suburban restaurants with mid-priced menus are doing OK. So are fast-food outlets and casual dining chains. I understand that several highnd restaurants in New York and San Francisco have closed down.</br>
Ohtaki:And the restaurant owners and employees aren't the only ones being affected. Their small suppliers-specialty farmers, pheasant breeders, organic vegetable growers and cheese makers. --may go out of business due to the downturn.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L18_04">L18-04</div>
Ohtaki:My family eats out frequently, b my family eats out frequently, but never in the big city. We go to estaurants in New Jersey that are casual, easy on the wallet, and ve the kind of food we like. It's quicker and cheaper to do that than go shopping, and certainly beats washing dishes after dinner.</br>
Lyon:ils much the same where I live. My friends and I order what we might otherwise eat at home, old favorites like clam chowder, lamb chops with mint jelly, spaghetti with meat sauce, and a slice of apple pie. Down-home comfort food sells well. Few of us are interested in exotic ethnic cuisine. We go out for good old American family food.</br>
White:I wouldn't second that sentiment. My family likes to eat at a wide variety of restaurants. We live in a diverse area where ethnic eateries abound. We'll go out for Thai, Greek, Indian, Mexican or Moroccan, provided the price is right.</br>
Sanchez:It's of interest to me that the taste shifts in restaurants are not only about the food. There has also been a big taste shift in interior decor, and that goes for hotels as well. Look at the success of the boutique hotels in the past ten years.</br>
Ohtaki:That's true. Conventional hotels are losing out. They've seen the writing on the wall: get hip or get lost.</br>

<div id="id_L19_01">L19-01</div>
Minna Fisk:I like the black dress, Iris. It's simple but chic. Where did you get it?</br>
Iris Haydn:It was on sale at Sommer's department store. Black is back for women's pants and dresses. I also picked up a casual black long! skirt and sweater. One of the salespeople told me that casual black is the hot fashion statement now.</br>
Hiram White:That goes for men as well. I still keep a tuxedo in my closet, but for most social occasions I wear a simple black jacket. There haven't been a lot of parties lately, and with more people inclined to stay home and hang out with their families, there really isn't a need for fancy get-ups. That's another reason why the casual look is back in fashion.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:When I was working here in New York a few years ago, the dot-com boom had people wearing sport shirts, jeans and sneakers to work. I stuck with a suit and tie in line with my company's conservative dress code and because I felt a more formal look made a better impression on people I did business with. I'm not opposed to casual dressing, but I feel more comfortable in a business suit or a sport jacket when I'm on the job.</br>
Fisk:Between the time you went back to Japan and then came here to earson, the casual dot-com look went out of style with the Internet bust.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L19_02">L19-02</div>
Fisk:I'd say a lot of company managers were pleased when business suits bounced back into fashion. nite: There was talk all along that going overboard on the casual look made dot-commers take a casual approach to work too. Freedom to do your own thing may be good for some people, but others got so sloppy and out of focus that a lot of fledgling dot-com companies went downhill.</br>
Haydn:With so many dot-commers out of work and pounding the pavement for new jobs, we saw an upsurge in suits and ties. After all, you don't present yourself well for a job interview if you show up in a T-shirt and baggy pants.</br>
Ohtaki:Did that have an impact on Pearson's dress code? Or did Pearson never go casual to begin with?</br>
Fisk:We played around with casual days for a year or two, but it never really caught on. Most of us have meetings with clients who tend to stick to the middle of the road. We see what they wear, which is somewhat in between casual and formal, and we toe that line ourselves. I've never worn jeans to meetings. Even when the business casual trend was riding high, I compromised by wearing pantsuits. I came as more credible and professional with that fashion state</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L19_03">L19-03</div>
Haydn:We should be thankful that we're not living way back in the '50s when the dress code for the white collar workforce was much more stringent. Men had to dress in dark suits, dark shoes, crisp white shirts and conservative ties. Women wore skirts, never pants. The first pantsuits were a scandal. We have far more freedom of choice as things stand now.</br>
Fisk:If we judged New York by that standard, half of our daytime population might be mistaken for entertainers. Other than that, I'm sure I'm not the only one looking for outfits that are adaptable to business and social situations.</br>
White:I look for that too. I like suits that are versatile, so I can wear the jacket and pants in several different combinations. Sometimes that translates into dressing down. For me, however, dressing down is not wearing anything that looks cheap and shabby. Also, I make it a point to be well-groomed. Casual should not be synonymous with scruffy. I shave every day and keep my hair neat and trimmed. If I had a beard. I'd trim it too.</br>
Haydn:Well, Hiram, we wouldn't want you to come into the office looking like Rip Van Winkle after a 20-year nap. [Laughter] Seriously, though, I think the recent casual phase we're seeing now is going to fade away fairly soon.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L19_04">L19-04</div>
Haydn:Fashion will stop yo-yoing between casual and formal, and will settle down to a happy middle ground. Designers have sensed that and are heading in the direction of mix-and-match separates that are casual, yet tasteful.</br>
Ohtaki:I'm for tailored blazers or sport jackets that I can mix with pants in different shades of gray, brown or blue. That's not only versatile, but also economical, because I don't have to buy a matching pair of pants every time I buy a jacket.</br>
Fisk:Reiji, your jacket today is a tasteful combination of pastel green, brown and pale gray. It goes well with trousers in any one of those three colors, and you can take it from a client call to a semi-formal cocktail party. It must be quite a change from the standard corporate uniform of dark-blue suits you used to wear.</br>
White:At least, you haven't changed to another sort of uniform. How many Wall Streeters and other guys we see on the streets play it safe with a uniform of polo shirts, chino pants and drab shoes? With all the freedom to dress as we choose, those sheep choose to dress like they just stepped out of prep school. I'll give them three Bronx cheers for cheerless conformity.</br>
Haydn:Hear, hear. I'm all for trying out something that's new and different if it looks businesslike and dare I say it-flatters my middle-aged figure. [Laughter.]</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L20_01">L20-01</div>
Minna Fisk:We've all seen the results of the hand-washing survey. The key finding is that Americans don't wash their hands as much as they say they do. About 95 percent of men and women believe that they wash their hands frequently, but under observation in public restrooms only two-thirds did. Nelsonex wants to cosponsor a clean hands campaign that will highlight the reasons why dirty hands can be a high risk to our health.</br>
Don Hopkins:We need to include specific examples to drive the point home. For instance, we should wash our hands after we pet a dog or cat, after we handle uncooked food and before we sit down to eat. The same goes for when we cough, sneeze or blow our noses, and whenever we put in or take out our contact lenses. Can you think of any other examples offhand?</br>
Anita Sanchez:Yes, we should wash after we handle money, change a diaper, or use the bathroom at home. Of course, we should wash our hands in public restrooms too.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:The city-to-city comparisons were interesting to me. New Yorkers have the dirtiest hands. Fewer than half of them wash their hands in public restrooms. Chicago and San Francisco topped the list at 83 and 80 percent respectively. Around two-thirds of people washed regularly in Atlanta and New Orleans.</br>
Fisk:Another disparity was between women and men.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L20_02">L20-02</div>
Fisk:At one observation spot in a sports stadium, 84 percent of women washed compared to only 36 percent of men. That tells me I'm much safer from germs if I'm seated between two women rather than two men at a baseball game. Live and learn. Anyway, the focal point of the campaign is the importance of hand washing as one way to ward off the spread of infections. 19-1127</br>
Hopkins:It's a simple and effective way to prevent contagion by the microbes that infect us with common colds, influenza, diarrhea, and even more serious or deadly diseases. Again, let's be specific with hard-hitting facts and figures. Dirty hands contribute to public health epidemics. According to the supporting data we have, washing can also be a first line of defense against bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.</br>
Sanchez:Then we have risk of infection in childcare centers. Over 30 percent of children under 6 spend time in daycare. We're talking seven million kids, all told. They're at risk for lung and stomach diseases. On top of that, they're carriers who bring those diseases home to their families and neighbors. Careful hand washing can decrease that risk, especially in cases of diarrhea.</br>
Ohtaki:I've got my eye on illness related to food. Nearly 80 million Americans contract food-related diseases each year, and 5,000 of them die as a direct result.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L20_03">L20-03</div>
Ohtaki:Hands that aren't washed can transfer germs from infected raw beef, pork, chicken and eggs. Most of us know about the menace of eating food infected with E. coli bacteria, but we also need to know that we can get sick from touching any surface that's coated with E. coli.</br>
Fisk:Cast an eye on pet infections as well. People who keep iguanas, turtles or other reptiles as pets are falling ill from salmonella infections. Those of us who have pets should wash our hands right after we handle them and after we clean up their waste matter. V</br>
Hopkins:We have a stack of medical data including reports in medical journals. Let's break that down into several themes. Reiji, would you take charge of any and all data related to food? Anita, please lend a hand with data related to healthcare ranging from daycare centers to hospitals.</br>
Sanchez:Consider it done. I've already noticed some bone-chilling data from hospital surveys. Most doctors and nurses believe they wash their hands properly, but on average, they wash with soap and water only 30 percent of the time after contact with patients or between treatment procedures. Some of them don't wash at all. How can w convince the general public to wash their hands if professional health care practitioners don't set a high standard for daily hygiene?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L20_04">L20-04</div>
Ohtaki:There's no easy answer, but it does imply that the campaign should take aim at healthcare facilities, as well as John and Jane Doe. For that reason alone, we should include pointers on good hand-washing techniques. First off, a quick rinse is not enough. Wash with soap and warm running water.</br>
Fisk:It's also important to wash all over, from wrists to fingertips, the palm and back of the hand, and under the fingernails. Dry off with a clean hand towel or disposable paper towel. To fend off dry skin, use a hand lotion after a good wash.</br>
Hopkins:I've jotted that down. Let's move on to media strategy. I suggest we kick off with a piece for wire service pickup. That will maximize the audience we want to reach. We could also plug into a major healthcare congress to officially announce the campaign. I'll surf the Web and find out what's cooking in anti-infective medical meetings next year.</br>
Sanchez:Let's try to tie up with the biggest meeting and schedule a press event. We'll need some educational info for the press kit, maybe a consumer brochure, a poster and a sticker. We can do the brochure. M&B can design posters and stickers to go into restrooms at airports. train and subway stations, schools and daycare centers, as well as clinics, hospitals and other healthcare facilities.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L21_01">L21-01</div>
Peter Neeson:Gabby, these facts and figures on cat and dog blood donations are absolutely fascinating. I didn't know there were four national animal blood banks. Gabby Mann: I didn't either. Chow Down told me about the blood donor program. They're eager to be the commercial sponsor for a nationwide blood drive, so M&B surfed the Netdod pertinent information. The blood banks are there, but sadly, there is not enough blood to treat all dogs and cats in critical condition. All four of the blood banks have back orders from veterinary clinics on waiting lists of six to eight weeks for dog and cat plasma.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Clinics are running local blood drives of their own, but there's still not enough blood to go around. Pet owners are more than I willing to shell out small fortunes for treatments, including blood transfusions, but if a clinic doesn't have an ample blood supply, that dog or cat on the operating table may not survive.</br>
Anita Sanchez:I see that California has the largest animal blood bank. It supplies 3,000 clinics in North America with up to 2,000 units a month. Even so, dogs that need blood outnumber those able to donate.</br>
Neeson:I can see why. Only five percent of all dogs can meet the donor criteria.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L21_02">L21-02</div>
Neeson:To qualify, they need to be vaccinated and disease-free. Size is also important. A golden retriever, for instance, can donate a pint of blood with no problem, but you can't draw a whole pint from a cocker spaniel. Mann: A leading reason for the shortage is that vet clinics and hospitals are doing more treatments. People often treat pets as members of the family When Spot needs to go under the knife, he matters as much as a child to his household, no matter how much it costs to give him a new "leash" on life.</br>
Ohtaki:That can take a big bite out of the owner's bank account. Some people will pay $25,000 for a kidney transplant for their pet.</br>
Sanchez:That's just the tip of the iceberg. Some owners fork out $1,000 a week for dialysis treatments. If Fido needs braces or jaw surgery to improve his bite, we're talking five figures. Now that's what I call "puppy love."</br>
Neeson:There's no doubt in my mind that healthcare for pets is a growth industry. We have a host of new technologies for medical care and a rising number of pet healthcare insurance policies. Owners will go over the top to keep their pets in fine fettle. It says here that cancer treatments alone have shot up 50 percent in the past three years.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L21_03">L21-03</div>
Mann: There is an active debate among pet care specialists concerning some treatments. A number of critics in the know contend that vets tend to prescribe high-priced treatments that do next to nothing to benefit a pet's quality of life.</br>
Neeson:Here on page two, we're told that we have chiropractors certified to treat pets and their owners. The number of certified pet dentists is also rising. Animal hospitals now provide counseling so pet owners can make informed decisions before they give the nod to treatments costing hundreds or thousands of dollars.</br>
Mann: At any rate, we can't equate today's companion animals with yesterday's pets. Twenty years ago, vets were more likely to recommend putting sick pets to sleep, but owners won't stand for that now. They form such a close bond with their pets that euthanasia ceases to be an option. In some cases, owners have a real dependence on companion animals such as seeingye and service dogs. Apart from that, there are studies that endorse the extra health benefits of keeping pets among people of all ages.</br>
Ohtaki:The only pets at my house live in a tropical aquarium. However, my kids are enrolled in a school pet-care program. They have chances to bond with hamsters and rabbits. They came home in tears last month after one of the rabbits died. There was a short burial service the next morning.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L21_04">L21-04</div>
Sanchez:The death of a pet is often the first time kids have to face fact all living things eventually die. I was seven when our family died. My mother was devastated. She loved that cat. Without a word my father took the cat to a taxidermist. A month later, Max was back in his favorite spot. We knew he was dead, but he looked so alive. His bright eyes were really eerie.</br>
Neeson:Taxidermy used to be the most popular option for people who couldn't let go of a favorite pet. Recently, though, pet owners who can't accept pet loss are having their pets freeze-dried. It's quicker and much less expensive.</br>
Sanchez:Most animal lovers are opposed to freeze-drying pets. They think it's gross.</br>
Neeson:Did you hear about the dispute on the subject of whether pets go to heaven? Around 40 percent say, yes, pets go to heaven. But another 40 percent insist that heaven is for people only. When you come right down to it, we won't know for sure until we kick the bucket. Mann: You've got a point. By the way, have any of you seen some of the Web sites that provide comfort to people who've just lost a pet? I found one that provides expert/bereavement counseling on pet loss. Grieving pet lovers can sign up as members to visit chat rooms, receive private e-mail, and attend seminars and workshops.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L22_01">L22-01</div>
Ohtaki Reiji:My kids brought this pamphlet home from school about an NGO called Helping Hand. They're urging me to join. For $25 a month our family can sponsor a deprived child in Africa, Asia or Latin America. Have you heard of it? cosparsor pots</br>
Heidi Lyon:Sure. I joined three years ago. has been contributing even longer than that. As a matter of fact, you can join through Pearson and have the $25 deducted from your salary. It's tax-deductible too.</br>
Don Hopkins:You can choose the child you want to support, boy or girl, from a number of candidate profiles including photos. You can't stipulate how your donation will be spent. Helping Hand makes that decision on a case-by-case basis. Ordinarily, though, your contribution will enable your chosen child to go to school, get medical checkups, improve the family home or upgrade their farm.</br>
Anita Sanchez:The benefits can extend beyond one family to the community as a whole. Many of Helping Hand's programs support communities at the grassroots level. Donations may be partly used to build a schoolhouse, for instance. Of course, you do get a yearly update, with photos, about your particular child as well as regular updates on community improvements. Many of us become pen pals bers with "our" kids.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L22_02">L22-02</div>
Ohtaki:With its 60-year history, Helping Hand certainly seems solid. All told, more than a million kids are sponsored worldwide, with nearly 90,000 sponsored by U.S. contributors alone.</br>
Hopkins:Note that it's nonprofit and has no political or religious ties. There are five major programs devoted to helping kids grow up in good health, providing education, aiding family livelihood, promoting community development and building solid relationships.</br>
Lyon:Communities benefit from programs that provide for drinkable water, efficient sewage disposal, vaccination campaigns, dental care and mobile health clinics.</br>
Ohtaki:This pamphlet comments on all that. I also see that Helping Hand is active in training programs for raising farm animals, as well as producing food, storing it and getting it on the market. In all, that's quite a comprehensive roster of activities for needy communities.</br>
Hopkins:The overall goal is to empower families and communities. That's why Helping Hand doesn't hand out cash to the families of the children we sponsor. The money is much better spent on giving the kids and their parents the kinds of practical support services that really make a difference in the long run.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L22_03">L22-03</div>
Lyon:The hopeful end result is a community that can sustain itself with no further help.</br>
Sanchez:We've also seen an upsurge in American families that volunteer for civic duties. In general, donations to charities are on the rise. More than ever before, local charities are lending a helping hand to workers who were laid off because of the economic downturn. As a sign of the times, last November we had our first National Family Volunteer Day.</br>
Ohtaki:told me about that over lunch a while back. She said volunteering gives families a good chance to spend quality time together. It for teaches children that teamwork is important. Helping can be a way of healing too, especially if they've suffered a tragedy close to home. Families can choose to visit people in nursing homes, coordinate food drives, or pick up litter in a park and plant flowers along the way. My family participates in a "keep our streets clean" campaign on occasional Saturdays.</br>
Iris Lyon:I asked why he's so keen on public service activities in his community. He gave me two reasons. One is the good it does for the whole neighborhood. The other reason is that it strengthens family ties, because every member of the family volunteers to do things together.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L22_04">L22-04</div>
Hiram Hopkins:If one family member chooses to volunteer, it can have a snowball effect. Everyone else gets interested and opts to pitch in. An entire family helping to keep streets clean can be an inspiration to others. Neighbors see a family hard at work while still having fun together. Then they decide to get into the act. Pretty soon you've got all sorts of families building community spirit and making a real contribution to the public good.</br>
Sanchez:Incidentally, Family Volunteer Day didn't suddenly come out of thin air. Its beginnings date back ten years with test runs in various communities from coast to coast. The original goal was to study the impact of families as volunteers. A number of success stories demonstrated that volunteering brought families closer together and enabled them to do some good in the process.</br>
Ohtaki:Has Family Volunteer Day stirred up much publicity?</br>
Lyon:Yes, I should say so. There was a skillful campaign to build up media interest beforehand. Interested communities got a "how to" kit with tips on recruiting families. As the campaign gathered steam, the media were hit with a barrage of press kits, news releases and other materials. Celebrities and their families also pitched in as campaign spokespeople.</br>
Hopkins:It was so successful just six weeks after the launch, 100 communities pledged to participate in the campaign.</br>
</br>

Iris Haydn:Hi, guys. I'm delighted you decided to join us at our summer intern farewell party. Meet Melanie Mays. Melanie did her internship in Pearson's Financial Services Division this summer.</br>
Peter Neeson:Pleased to meet you, Melanie. I'm Neeson and this is my sidekick, Reiji. We're in Pearson's Food and Nutrition Division. Melanie Mays: Hi. It's nice to meet you both.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:Did you apply directly to Pearson for the internship or did a third party refer you?</br>
Haydn:The answer is yes and yes. Melanie submitted her resume, cover letter and writing samples directly to Pearson's internship program. A week later I received her other application via Student Salute. They had vetted her and then referred her to me. ngs back memories of my internship interview with you years ago, Iris. I still remember some of your questions. asked me for my thoughts on how an image of a company is for in the public eye. And when I said that I considered myself to be ative, organized and articulate, you made sure I backed that up specific examples. Mays: Sounds familiar. asked me why I wanted to have hands experience in public relations.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L23_02">L23-02</div>
Mays: I said that a basic understanding of what PR can do for a client is a useful tool in any professional field. When I start my senior year next month, the experience I've gained at Pearson will help me tackle employment applications and job interviews.</br>
Iris Ohtaki:That tells me you're well organized. Can you tell me a little more about the structure of the internship program?</br>
Haydn:I'll field that one. Our program offers on-the-job training in clients' promotion and publicity campaigns. Interns learn how to do planning and production, media research and media contact, just to scratch the surface.</br>
Neeson:My mentor immersed me in video and print production, in addition to media training. I tried my hand at speechwriting, mapped out events and took a stab at designing house journals. Melanie, what did you gain from your experience at Pearson? Mays: I feel confident I've built up skills that will stand me in good stead for a long time to come, even if I don't choose public relations as a career path. At my formal evaluation with Iris, we talked about my overall progress and projected some possible career goals. Some companies treat interns as gofers, but I wasn't buried in meaningless work. I was constantly given demanding assignments that pushed my creativity to the limits.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L23_03">L23-03</div>
Mays: Last but not least, will see to it that I get academic credit for completing the internship with flying colors.</br>
Iris Ohtaki:Congratulations on that as well.</br>
Haydn:Designing and implementing Pearson's summer internship program was one of the first loads I shouldered after I was appointed HR manager. was in my first crop of student trainees.</br>
Peter Neeson:I remember you warning us that slackers need not apply. On the other hand, you promised us that we would be given projects we could sink our teeth into rather than just filing or answering phones for little or no pay. I could look forward to a summer that would be tough, but exciting and rewarding. And that's exactly what happened. </br>
Mays: Before I did a lick of work, and I hooked up with Jason Cage, my mentor. Jason said straight out that he didn't want a wimp under his wing. I cringed when I heard that, but I got the point. I made it clear that I didn't intend to waste his time or mine.</br>
Iris Neeson:Good for you. Mays: I asked him right off to define my responsibilities, lead me through an orientation process, and give me constant feedback on how I was doing. We clicked from that moment on. He made sure ! had challenges to face every step of the way. I adored him for that. It made the whole experience worthwhile.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L23_04">L23-04</div>
Ohtaki:Is it customary for companies to pay interns for their work?</br>
Neeson:When I interned at Pearson, I was paid minimum wage, which was common for many companies. However, since then Pearson has joined other companies in structuring pay on the basis of an intern's abilities and practical skills. In other words, it's tiered compensation on a case-by-case basis. Then there are companies that demand the cream of the crop for internships. They may offer a scholarship to go along with an attractive wage to get the best talent on tap.</br>
Haydn:In Melanie's case, I made it clear that pay would be minimum wage, but in view of her star quality, I sweetened the pot with a $2,500 scholarship. I felt confident she was worth every penny of that. I'll even let you in on a little secret. At Jason's recommendation, I've nominated you to Student Salute for an Outstanding Performance Award. </br>
Mays: Thank you so much. I think Jason deserves an Outstanding Performance citation from Student Salute. I'm going to propose an Outstanding Mentor Award as a new category.</br>
Ohtaki:That's a wonderful idea. Iris, when you have a chance. I'd love to hear more about the program. Where I come from, internships are few and far between. Most companies haven't adopted the idea, because they can't grasp its practical value.</br>

<div id="id_L24_01">L24-01</div>
Don Hopkins:Iris, thanks for circulating the consolidated polls and surveys on how hard people are working these days. It certainly opened my eyes. A vast majority of the respondents said they're overworked and need more fun and a long vacation.</br>
Iris Haydn:The telling question is not about putting in long hours on the job, but whether it's worth it. Stated that way, about one-half of workers say it's worth it because they need the income. The other half feel it's not worth it because it's stressful and doesn't leave much time for other pursuits.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:There's a disparity between men and women too. Well over half of the men think working overtime is worthwhile, whereas less than 40 percent of women agree with that. You've also got age to factor in. The majority of young workers don't mind the grind, since they see it as a chief ingredient in their success and prosperity.</br>
Heidi Lyon:Those who feel most pressured by heavy workloads are moms and dads who can't spend much time with the kids. Both parents are busting their butts because a single income isn't sufficient to w cover their cost of living.</br>
Ohtaki:It may not be a matter of logging a lot of overtime on the job. There can be other reasons why workers feel overworked and stressed.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L24_02">L24-02</div>
Ohtaki:Stress-related social trends such as road rage, workplace violence, and fear of terrorism take their toll as well. Even people who aren't putting in 60-hour workweeks feel overworked and fatigued by that kind of overload.</br>
Lyon:According to another government report, we've got 25 million workers, or one-fifth of our workforce, claiming they put in 50 hours a week. About half say that it's more like 60 hours. Here's the fly in the ointment. Most of them are white collar types who don't punch a clock. We've only got their word for how hard they work. Still, I don't mean to be splitting hairs. Even people who juggle 40-hour weeks with responsibilities at home need time off to unwind.</br>
Haydn:In effect, leisure time is cut down by workloads both outside and at home. That's why large numbers of people feel they're working harder, with little time left over for R&R. Even scant leisure time can vanish if people need to bring some of their office workloads home.</br>
Hopkins:If we delve a bit deeper into that, it indicates that the average 40-hour workweek is an illusion. Added to that is the income factor. People who have income in the $30,000 to $60,000 bracket are three times more likely to put in extra hours than people who earn less than $30,000.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L24_03">L24-03</div>
Ohtaki:Anyhow, now we have this U.N. study that concludes U.S. workers are working harder than employees in any other industrialized country. We've supposedly got our noses to the grindstone even more so than workers in Germany and Japan. If total work time over one year is measured, Americans are working a month more than the Japanese workforce and nearly three months more than German workers.</br>
Lyon:In conclusion, the U.N. study informs us that the increased number of work hours in the U.S. is running counter to the general trend of declining work hours in other industrialized countries. What are we getting out of the world's heaviest workloads? I guess we have enough income to put the kids through college and to buy the house we set our hearts on.</br>
Hopkins:The next question is what's the price we pay for spending most of our lives as chronic workaholics? OK, we live in the world's richest country. However, we also have the world's fattest population. Our sedentary lifestyles, lack of physical exercise, and overeating really put on pounds. Also, when endless work is the be-all and endall, we don't have any quality time left for our loved ones, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation.</br>
Haydn:We can also be trapped by technology. In many workplaces we're expected to be on call around the clock.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L24_04">L24-04</div>
Haydn:That's why so many of us are obliged to have cell phones and laptop computers. Home isn't homey when it's just an extension of the workplace. To me, though, the most disheartening downside to overdig work is what it does to marriages and children. That's why I included 5 new information on what's happening with daycare centers.</br>
Ohtaki:I'll say. They've turned into day-and-night care. Parents working night shifts drop off their kids at dusk and don't pick them up until dawn. How often do those preschool children have a chance to spend a night at home?</br>
Lyon:I guess the good old days when a single income was enough to support a family are long gone. It takes a double income to make ends meet for many families. Si no time tots</br>
Haydn:The worst-case scenario is leaving the children on their own at home. What happens if a tot left alone plays with matches and starts a fire or drinks poisonous kitchen detergent? In a child care center, at least the kids are kept under adult supervision.</br>
Ohtaki:Maybe the best-case scenario is a company care center within a 10-minute drive from a parent's workplace or on company premises. One corporate employer decided to build its own 24-hour care centers because the leading reason for employee absenteeism was sick children at home.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L25_01">L25-01</div>
Minna Fisk:Reiji, how was your meeting with Sue Ellen Metz?</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:We fine-tuned a few of the recipes for the children's nutrition booklet, so that's over and done with. I'll circulate the final text with a cover memo. Other than that, Sue Ellen had some disturbing news about upcoming layoffs at Nelsonex. She thinks she's in no danger, but there will be a 10 to 12 percent cut in the workforce.</br>
Heidi Lyon:We've heard about it through the grapevine, but according to Lee Seymour, it won't have any impact on Pearson or M&B. I feel sorry for the Nelsonex people who won't be on the payroll after the next month or two. I can only hope they're prepared when they have to bow out.</br>
Hiram White:The closest Pearson has ever come to letting people go was a call for early retirement several years ago. liaised with an outplacement service for those who volunteered to leave, and she also provided personal counseling to those who needed it.</br>
Iris Fisk:I'd guess that many of those who are being laid off, particularly in shaky industries, are looking for types of work with more job security.</br>
White:Right now the riskiest industries are high-tech, travel and manufacturing. The hottest ones are defense, energy, healthcare and insurance.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L25_02">L25-02</div>
White:Nowadays, workers often have portable skills. Iris, for instance, could use her human resource skills in a healthcare business.</br>
Ohtaki:That's how it'happened for me in one step from a pharmaceutical company to a public relations firm. told me right off that employers, especially in the communications business, are quite eager to hire applicants with a diversified background. They can contribute new ideas to a company. That's why it's a wise idea for people to define their value by what they do, not by the business field they're in. Career changes like mine are more commonplace, because many people want to keep on working full-time into their 60s and 70s.</br>
Iris Lyon:My dad was in the banking industry for 20 years. After the first massive layoff wave, he resigned and signed on with a small but highly specialized insurance company. He's doing fine there. He said that a laid-off executive should not limit a job search to big corporations. A smaller company may be the best choice in the long run. </br>
Fisk:It used to be utterly devastating if you got the chop in your 50s. We've seen homeless men in their 70s still eking out a hopeless living on the streets. The good news is that many companies have come to arealize that a 50-year-old is not too old to cut the mustard.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L25_03">L25-03</div>
White:Laid-off workers over 50 also risk being considered overqualified. I recently came across a Web site that connects older workers to recruiters who specialize in job placement for senior executives. They can also network with human resource managers (at hundreds of companies. visits chat rooms where out-of-work execs interface with each other and sympathetic counselors.</br>
Iris Ohtaki:I remember that while I was waiting to meet her the first time, her office door was ajar. I overheard her advising someone. "Don't try to pull rank," she said. "Hierarchy doesn't matter at your age. What does matter is the business fields in which you have experience and expertise. That's your selling point to any prospective employer." I wasn't surprised to see that the guy who came out seemed to be in his mid-50s.</br>
White:Many companies are looking for ways to avoid giving their employees the ax. A company in trouble could share its employees with another company that needs workers. It could consolidate offices and put more employees into telecommuting. It could offer stock options in exchange for pay cuts.</br>
Ohtaki:Something like one-half of all U.S. companies are looking for creative ways to cut costs and keep their employees during a temporary downturn.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L25_04">L25-04</div>
Fisk:Why drop them altogether if you can offer a part-time arrangement? Some people will be more than pleased to cut down their hours ep their benefits. Another option is work sharing. Two employees share the same position and give the company doubled energy and doubled expertise. You know, like two heads are better than one.</br>
White:Phased retirement may be appealing. If an employee is close to retirement age, phasing out provides time to shift into a different lifestyle while the company continues to tap into his or her expertise.</br>
Ohtaki:I understand that M&B has tried the sabbatical route. Employees can take time off for six months or a year and still keep their benefits, rank and employment rights. M&B can cut costs without losing top talent. There's no negative impact on employee morale, since a sabbatical is voluntary.</br>
Lyon:Companies sometimes jump the gun on layoffs. They don't consider the hidden cost of morale. Employees who remain in place may suffer from post-layoff syndrome and feel depressed and listless. The quality of their work declines. Some companies are calling in counselors to contend with deteriorating work performance.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L26_01">L26-01</div>
Minna Fisk:Hiram, what's your vacation pick this year?</br>
Hiram White:The whole family voted overwhelmingly for Las Vegas. Does that surprise you?</br>
Anita Sanchez:Not at all. Las Vegas has changed. I went there with friends a couple of years ago. None of us are gamblers, so we skipped the casinos, except for a quick stop to try our luck at the one-armed bandits. We spent our time at fabulous museums and art galleries, first-class theaters and dinner shows, and we even took a day tour to some Old West ghost towns.</br>
Ohtaki Reiji:told me that the "new" Las Vegas has evolved into an increasingly popular family resort. Children love the circus acts and amusement parks. Business at the newer resort hotels is based on something for every member of the family. I can understand why Hiram's kids are so eager to go there.</br>
Don Fisk:There's no doubt that Las Vegas is growing by leaps and bounds. It not only draws nearly 36 million visitors per year, but it's also "home sweet home" for almost a million and a half residents. I've read that an average of 6,000 more people decide to move there each and every month. That makes it the fastest-growing city in the United yn States.</br>
Sanchez:What a change from 50 years ago, when it was nothing more than a sand-battered desert hamlet.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L26_02">L26-02</div>
Sanchez:Strangely enough, it was saved from becoming a ghost town by a couple of mobsters from California. Lo and behold, the first casinos opened up and Las Vegas made a stunning comeback. Look at it now. It's been called the "first city of the 21st century.” to po prostoru</br>
Ohtaki:This country has an economy that's going postindustrial and service-based, with Las Vegas as its poster child. I guess it has to keep on changing, because gambling alone can't keep it going, now that gambling is legal in 46 out of 50 states. pl (7)</br>
White:The future for Las Vegas may not be all that rosy. Some people believe it won't be too long before the boom goes bust, because the city is growing too fast. The lure of the American dream is what's drawing those new residents, many of whom are hoping to make their rags-to-riches dreams come true.</br>
Sanchez:As a hard-nosed New Yorker, I'm not inclined to believe there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Still, I can see its good points. After all, Las Vegas is a place where a hotel room maid can make $30,000 a year, with tips, not to mention full benefits, thanks to a feisty labor union and the revenue from all those slot machines, blackjack tables and roulette wheels.</br>
Ohtaki:My wife and I did Vegas when I was posted here with my previous employer. Going there again, this time with the kids, is a tempting idea, but maybe next year.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L26_03">L26-03</div>
Ohtaki:This time we're going to Singapore. My parents volunteered to visit us for two weeks and will take the kids off to Orlando for some Granddad and Grandmom bonding while Miyoko and I tramp around the tropical rain forests.</br>
Fisk:Until went there, I couldn't believe ecotourism could exist in Singapore. I thought it was no more than a small city-state. I mean, it's the third-densest population center on the planet, after Macao and Hong Kong. How could there be any space left over for even a token palm tree?</br>
Hiram White:Figures can be deceiving. Yes, the population is dense in certain areas. The underlying reason is due to efficient government planning. Urban, residential and industrial zones are confined mostly to the island's perimeter. Go 20 kilometers inland and you hit tropical jungle. Jungles surround a central reservoir that reduces Singapore's dependence on imported water. The land around it is covered by Southeast Asian rain forest from lush valleys to steep hills.</br>
Sanchez:I saw an ecotouring special about Singapore on cable just a couple of weeks ago. There are popular parks crowded on weekends at some edges of the jungle, but once you head into the deep interior you may not meet anyone else.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L26_04">L26-04</div>
Sanchez:In all, Singapore has four nature preserves you can explore to your heart's content.</br>
Ohtaki:That's the main event for us, but we're also looking forward to good restaurants for first tastes of Singaporean cuisine. has recommended several places close to the nature trails. A half-day of hiking is bound to work up a hearty appetite. There's a curry restaurant that sounds great. It's locally famous for its lamb, chicken and crab curries, flat Indian bread and cold, soursop juice. Near another preserve we can eat dinner alfresco on a terrace under shade trees, maybe starting with steamed dumplings and ending with a chilled sago pudding laced with coconut milk.</br>
Hiram Fisk:Stop it. You're making my mouth water. Maybe I'll slate Singapore falowed by for next year. I'm not the hiking type, but a short stroll on a jungle plug trail, followed by a lazy lunch, could suit me to a T. Come to think of it, Lee Seymour had a Japanese coworker in her department at M&B. He was promoted and transferred to their office in Singapore. She pou could put you in touch with him. It might be a good idea to meet him and have a chat about the many cosmopolitan splendors of Singapore before you head off to the wilderness.</br>
White:Well, with everybody gone on vacation, we should have quite a trove of travel stories to share when we all get back here.</br>
