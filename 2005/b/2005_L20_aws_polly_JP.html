Minna Fisk:We've all seen the results of the hand-washing survey. The key finding is that Americans don't wash their hands as much as they say they do. About 95 percent of men and women believe that they wash their hands frequently, but under observation in public restrooms only two-thirds did. Nelsonex wants to cosponsor a clean hands campaign that will highlight the reasons why dirty hands can be a high risk to our health.
Don Hopkins:We need to include specific examples to drive the point home. For instance, we should wash our hands after we pet a dog or cat, after we handle uncooked food and before we sit down to eat. The same goes for when we cough, sneeze or blow our noses, and whenever we put in or take out our contact lenses. Can you think of any other examples offhand?
Anita Sanchez:Yes, we should wash after we handle money, change a diaper, or use the bathroom at home. Of course, we should wash our hands in public restrooms too.
Ohtaki Reiji:The city-to-city comparisons were interesting to me. New Yorkers have the dirtiest hands. Fewer than half of them wash their hands in public restrooms. Chicago and San Francisco topped the list at 83 and 80 percent respectively. Around two-thirds of people washed regularly in Atlanta and New Orleans.
Fisk:Another disparity was between women and men.

Fisk:At one observation spot in a sports stadium, 84 percent of women washed compared to only 36 percent of men. That tells me I'm much safer from germs if I'm seated between two women rather than two men at a baseball game. Live and learn. Anyway, the focal point of the campaign is the importance of hand washing as one way to ward off the spread of infections. 19-1127
Hopkins:It's a simple and effective way to prevent contagion by the microbes that infect us with common colds, influenza, diarrhea, and even more serious or deadly diseases. Again, let's be specific with hard-hitting facts and figures. Dirty hands contribute to public health epidemics. According to the supporting data we have, washing can also be a first line of defense against bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.
Sanchez:Then we have risk of infection in childcare centers. Over 30 percent of children under 6 spend time in daycare. We're talking seven million kids, all told. They're at risk for lung and stomach diseases. On top of that, they're carriers who bring those diseases home to their families and neighbors. Careful hand washing can decrease that risk, especially in cases of diarrhea.
Ohtaki:I've got my eye on illness related to food. Nearly 80 million Americans contract food-related diseases each year, and 5,000 of them die as a direct result.

Ohtaki:Hands that aren't washed can transfer germs from infected raw beef, pork, chicken and eggs. Most of us know about the menace of eating food infected with E. coli bacteria, but we also need to know that we can get sick from touching any surface that's coated with E. coli.
Fisk:Cast an eye on pet infections as well. People who keep iguanas, turtles or other reptiles as pets are falling ill from salmonella infections. Those of us who have pets should wash our hands right after we handle them and after we clean up their waste matter. V
Hopkins:We have a stack of medical data including reports in medical journals. Let's break that down into several themes. Reiji, would you take charge of any and all data related to food? Anita, please lend a hand with data related to healthcare ranging from daycare centers to hospitals.
Sanchez:Consider it done. I've already noticed some bone-chilling data from hospital surveys. Most doctors and nurses believe they wash their hands properly, but on average, they wash with soap and water only 30 percent of the time after contact with patients or between treatment procedures. Some of them don't wash at all. How can w convince the general public to wash their hands if professional health care practitioners don't set a high standard for daily hygiene?

Ohtaki:There's no easy answer, but it does imply that the campaign should take aim at healthcare facilities, as well as John and Jane Doe. For that reason alone, we should include pointers on good hand-washing techniques. First off, a quick rinse is not enough. Wash with soap and warm running water.
Fisk:It's also important to wash all over, from wrists to fingertips, the palm and back of the hand, and under the fingernails. Dry off with a clean hand towel or disposable paper towel. To fend off dry skin, use a hand lotion after a good wash.
Hopkins:I've jotted that down. Let's move on to media strategy. I suggest we kick off with a piece for wire service pickup. That will maximize the audience we want to reach. We could also plug into a major healthcare congress to officially announce the campaign. I'll surf the Web and find out what's cooking in anti-infective medical meetings next year.
Sanchez:Let's try to tie up with the biggest meeting and schedule a press event. We'll need some educational info for the press kit, maybe a consumer brochure, a poster and a sticker. We can do the brochure. M&B can design posters and stickers to go into restrooms at airports. train and subway stations, schools and daycare centers, as well as clinics, hospitals and other healthcare facilities.
