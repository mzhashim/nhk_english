<div id="id_L01_01">L01-01</div>
Joan Robinson: Hi, Shuzo. You look so excited, sitting there on the edge of your seat. What's up?</br>
Takahashi Shuzo: I got this e-mail yesterday asking me if I'm interested in a position in New York. They're looking for a Japanese account person in the Food and Nutrition Division. Do you guys know this company.</br>
Ken Bell: Marshall Egler? Sure. It's not a global giant like the one Joan works for. But it is a highly reputable midsize public relations firm specializing in down-to-earth marketing communications, especially food promotion. Why did it grab you? Aren't you happy where you are?</br>
Takahashi: No, not really. I joined the company straight out of college, and my work was very exciting for the first 10 years. At that point the former president, who was a true go-getter, decided to retire. He had constantly urged us to come up with promising new ideas for innovative growth. The new president, who took over two years ago, turned out to be ultraconservative. He only wants to maintain the status quo.</br>
Robinson: I see. So you feel you're stuck in a rut, spinning your wheels, going nowhere. I'd say it's time for a change. How can we help you?</br>
Takahashi: First off, I've never applied for a job.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L01_02">L01-02</div>
Takahashi: I don't even know how to write a proper application. Marshall Egler, though, wants candidates to forward applications to the Tokyo office for initial screening. If they're interested in you, they'll set up a preliminary interview here. If you pass that, your application will be forwarded to New York. Then, if you're still in the running, they'll give you a plane ticket for a final interview in New York. So this applicationis really important.</br>
Bell: Don't worry. You definitely have an edge over other potential candidates, Shuzo. You're a licensed dietitian with a baker's dozen years of hands-on experience at a Japanese fast-food chain. Another asset is your command of English, since you were raised in Chicago. And if I remember correctly, Marshal Egler is retained by, a number of Japanese food producers, including soy sauce and instant noodle companies.</br>
Robinson: First of all, you should prepare yourself well by studying background data on the firm. I can get you some recent articles from the U.S. trade press. Marshall Egler was at the top of this year's list of the best public relations companies to work for. It's known for a caring orporate culture, and yet they're quite aggressive in going after new business.</br>
Takahashi: Great. Sounds like the kind of company I'd like to start working for right away.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L01_03">L01-03</div>
Bell: I'll bet you do. But let's get back to basics. You need to write a resume and a cover letter. The resume is important, of course, but the cover letter can make all the difference between "yes" and "no" be cause it's their first impression of you.</br>
Robinson: And you don't get a second chance to make a good first impression, as my mother used to say.</br>
Takahashi: I get it. But let's start with the resume. What should go into it? My name, college degree, dietitian's license, job experience to date and what else?</br>
Robinson: I'd say "professional experience" rather than "job experience. Let me ask you a question. Did you ever have a personal role to play in company innovations?</br>
Takahashi: Yes, I did. For example, I proposed, formulated and helped to promote a new line of white meat burgers with fresh herbs and lightspices that was a big hit with young single women and older housewives who don't like greasy red meat. It was so successful that our promotion team received a citation from the president.</br>
Bell: What was your role on the promotion team?</br>
Takahashi: I participated in media briefings on the new product line from a dietitian's standpoint, commenting on calorie count, nutritional value and so on. I also wrote first drafts for press releases and information packets from the same point of view.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L01_04">L01-04</div>
Robinson: We're hitting pay dirt here. You know the food busines inside.out, and you know how to deal with the media. You should list any other successes that involved you in similar ways. Were you ever interviewed for publication?</br>
Takahashi: Yes quite a number of times, actually, by food and nutrition journalists who wanted a firsthand, behind-the-scenes focus on my personal role in launching successful product lines.</br>
Bell: Score that as another bull's-eye. Be sure to give yourself credit </br>
for what youve contributed to the company. Be careful that you donit come across as humble or self-effacing. You must sense the differences between Japanese and American business cultures. On the other side of the ocean, shrinking violets don't stand a chance.</br>
Robinson: On the other hand, don't resort to bravado. Be bold and forth-right, but not brash or boastful. You can call yourself "bright" but not brilliant Do you catch my drift?</br>
Takahashi: Yes, you made your point very well. Tell it like it is in an up-front tone of voice.</br>
Bell: Now let's focus on the cover letter. The first no-no is a spelling or grammar booboo. Never ever misspell the target company's name.</br>
Robinson: A common oversight is not giving a brief outline of your qualifications that you then expand on in your resume.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L01_05">L01-05</div>
Rohinson: Answer the hypothetical question of why that qualifies you to contribute much of value to the target company.</br>
Bell: Note that you feel confident that your past marketing ideas and experience can surely give rise to good ideas for new marketing campaigns. That will strike a high note at the end of the cover letter.</br>
Rohinson: Don't be satisfied with your first draft. Send it to us as it is, and we'll give you some solid advice on how to improve it.</br>
Takahashi: Now I know why I thought of both of you to give me a helping hand. I really need a couple pairs of eyes I can count on to get the right tone.</br>
Bell: Basically, the cover letter should demonstrate who you are. what skills you have and how well you communicate. The resume just follows on with supporting details. Keep it businesslike.</br>
Robinson: One more point comes to mind. Throughout the whole process, avoid saying anything disparaging about your company president or work situation. Let sleeping dogs lie. If you criticize him, it implies that you might criticize your next employer behind his back.</br>
Bell: If you want more advice, there are dozens of books and Web sites that give you good tips on doing an ideal resume and cover letter. However, that advice is largely ignored. Make sure you pay attention.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L01_06">L01-06</div>
Robinson: Don't just dash off your first draft and send it off instantly Keep on thinking how you could do it even better. We'll be happy to take a look and offer you some advice.</br>
Takahashi: When I've drafted the cover letter, I'll really appreciate your giving it a good going-over.</br>
Robinson: You bet. The reason I got my first shot at a job was because I spent five or six hours on my cover letter, revising it again and again.</br>
Takahashi: I know that if I goof up with the letter, any chance of an interview goes up in smoke right then and there.</br>
Robinson: Yep. The letter should be brief but upbeat. Say you can set! the world on fire.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_01">L02-01</div>
May Grey: Welcome to the Big Apple, Mr. Takahashi. I'm May Grey, Human Resources Manager at Marshall Egler, and with me is Dean Reid, Account Supervisor in our Food and Nutrition Division.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo: I'm pleased to meet you both. Please call me Shuzo, and thank you for inviting me to dinner.</br>
Dean Reid: That's our pleasure. How was your flight? Hope you didn't have any trouble. Running the gauntlet through Immigration, Customs and Security can be quite a hassle.</br>
Grey: Some people feel safer on board with airline pilots and sky marshals armed with pistols, but once an international carrier lands, everybody faces the very different fear of arriving at the airport.</br>
Takahashi: I had no problem. I've had nothing but courteous treatment at U.S. Immigration.</br>
Reid: How heavy was security? Getting used to new security measures just adds to the hassle and vexation of arriving.</br>
Grey: My worst moment was setting off the security sensor repeatedly at the checkpoint. I had no metal on me, but iust as I was faced with the prospect of an intensive botly search, I ramembered that I had metal in my knee from replacement surgery.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_02">L02-02</div>
Gres: When I proved that by putting only that leg in the checkpoint, I was told to carry an ID card with an X-ray photo to show that the knee will set off an alarm.</br>
Reid: The new reality in the post 9/11 world is that you must always be prepared to prove who you are. And not only that. We've all learned to leave shoes with metal shanks at home. Most of us wear slip-on shoes. Women wear bras with no underwire. Having knee braces or anything else metallic can result in a strip search.</br>
Takahashi: I mutter and grumble about the security checks like every one else, but deep down I feel that's how it should be to keep us safe and sound for air travel.</br>
Reid: Passengers complain that security can be inconsistent or silly, When a pen could be a weapon, why bother taking away nail files?</br>
Grey: Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, pilots were making announcements advising passengers to watch their seatmates for suspicious behavior and to be ready to stop anyone from storming the cabin. On a recent trip, though. I was very glad to hear the pilots announce sports results, just like the old days.</br>
Reid: I learned a lesson on a recent trip to Washington. I overdid the precaution and got to La Guardia almost two and half hours before departure time.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_03">L02-03</div>
Reid: And I ended up consuming too much coffee at the airport lounge. Only after boarding the New York-Washington shuttle, was I advised of the new federal regulation.</br>
Grey: Yes, using the bathroom could result in a $10,000 fine. By federal law, you can't leave your seat while the light is in airspace over the U.S. capital.</br>
Takahashi: It's important to know local regulations. In China they won't allow you to bring liquor or bottled liquid on board, since it could be gasoline in disguise.</br>
Reid: I trust you ate well. International lights serve food as usual, but meal service on domestic flights here in the U.S. is another story. Mostly, all you get is a drink and a packet of pretzels.</br>
Grey: So it's BYOF or bring your own food. People now take it for granted that they need to tote food for a long flight.</br>
Reid: Most passengers are careful not to pack food that wrinkles other people's noses. That's just good manners. But sometimes the smell of the assortment of food in a crowded cabin can be quite annoying.</br>
Grey: On the bright side, some carriers have started to test selling meals on board. They range from a snack box for three bucks to a full dinner for ten or so dollars. It's an extra expense, but the good old days of meals included in your ticket price will probably not make a comeback on domestic carriers.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_04">L02-04</div>
Takahashi: Not to change the subject, but I was told in Tokyo that hall Egler recently topped the list of best agencies to work for. I'd like to know why.</br>
Reid: Pardon us, Shuzo, for getting so absorbed in travel war stories, but that's a subject close to our hearts these days. And back to the purpose of our dinner. A leading trade journal gave us the kudos this year over and above other, larger agencies.</br>
Grey: When the annual survey was taken, almost two-thirds of us responded enthusiastically. That in itself is a round of applause for the company. Overall our people are very pleased with MarshEg's business culture, management style, benefits and the work we do.</br>
Takahashi: So the employees feel that their jobs are rewarding and they can build their careers in a first-rate workplace. That's excellent.</br>
Reid: You see, Shuzo, when I came into the company, I thought I would pick up some experience for a few years and then set up my own shop. I've changed my mind.</br>
Grey: In my own position at MarshEg. I would be the shoulder for dissatisfied staff people to weep on. That rarely happens, though. This is the best firm I've ever worked with. It's a model for other agencies to emulate for one reason: the management team is superb. You'll soon learn why. The people at the helm are smart, respectful, honest andgoal-focused, and all of that translates into the one word: outstanding.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_05">L02-05</div>
Reid: Believe me, you'll feel very lucky if you come on board. One of the first bright notes you soon begin to hear is the recognition given to each and every employee. It's a workforce that's full of fun as well as being motivated and energetic. The projects we carry out will knock your socks off. No one who lands a job at MarshEg feels an urge to work anywhere else.</br>
Grey: We continued to hire additional staff at a time when the rest of the profession was struggling. But our strikingly healthy culture is a cause,not an effect, of the firm's extraordinary performance during the downturn.</br>
Reid: Another thing stands out about us. That's our staff development program, which includes over 50 courses that range from classes designed to focus on our vision and values to professional training in media relations, workplace communication and branding.</br>
Takahashi: You're making me feel very excited already. Incidentally, I'll have to show up tomorrow wearing the same suit and tie. My luggage as misplaced at the airport. I hope I'll get it before I leave New York.</br>
Grey: Boy, do I feel sorry for you. I hope you get your bags back soon. Mine were once rerouted to the Middle East and didn't come back to New York for a month and a half.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L02_06">L02-06</div>
Takahashi: You have to know local regulations. It's a no-no in China to bring bottled liquid on board. Who knows. It could be kerosene. You either have to show it's safe by drinking from the bottle or abandon it.</br>
Reid: I guess you have to do as the Romans do. Here you can bring all sorts of food and beverages onto the airplane since most airlines have cut back on meal services.</br>
Takahashi: I've heard some warnings. Be careful in putting your laptop in the seatback pocket, because that's where some people staff what's left of oily carry on food.</br>
Reid: Midair mealtimes used to be regimented. Now eating goes on forever, so odors and trash permeate the cabin.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_01">L03-01</div>
Ben Walker: This is the first chance we've had to relax a bit and chat. May Grey mentioned that you had a hassle with your luggage last time. I hope it didn't happen again.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo: No, everything went without a hitch this time. </br>
Susan Caruso: How do you like your office? Is there anything else you want or need?</br>
Takahashi: Thanks. Nothing I can think of offhand. In Japan, I didn't have an office of my own. I worked in a crowded open office with desks in tight rows and very narrow aisles in between. A private office is a touch of luxury for me.</br>
Walker: This is only your first week on board, but have you looked into housing yet?</br>
Takahashi: I was referred to a couple of real estate agents who specialize in housing placements for Japanese families. I'll take time over the coming weekend to visit one or two promising communities. Of course my wife will have the last word on the house and the community we choose to live in.</br>
Caruso: Good. Holler if there's anything we can do for you.</br>
Takahashi: Thank you, Susan. I may do that at some point.</br>
Walker: Well then, let's get down to business. Shuzo, do you have any questions or comments on the background material?</br>
Takahashi: It gives me the big picture. And the strategy is crystal-clear.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_02">L03-02</div>
Takahashi: According to these fact sheets, nearly all the major food companies are now sponsoring programs centered on nutrition, and health and fitness education.</br>
Caruso: Yes, the food giants have seen the writing on the wall and have banded together to form a common front. As public relations consultants, we advised our food clients to focus on health issues from the very beginning.</br>
Takahashi: But will that be enough to fend off lawsuits as well as the specter of federal government regulation?</br>
Walker: Some regulation, such as restrictions on fat content, may crop up in the near future. But it could come after the fact, because the major food companies are already putting heavy emphasis on all possible ways to minimize fat in their products. Nutrition labeling is another issue under consideration. That's also pushing everyone toward more education for consumers.</br>
Caruso: According to a recent survey, 80 percent of all consumers feel responsible for what they choose to eat and drink. They understand it's a matter of personal behavior and personal responsibility.</br>
Takahashi: Over the long haul, then, the food industry needs to be involved in educating people about food choice for altogether healthier lifestyles.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_03">L03-03</div>
Takahashi: I was delighted to find out that our client has a long history of support for sports events and other programs aimed at getting people to be more active.</br>
Walker: Yes. Handan, here in America, was one of the first Japanese food companies to create a position of corporate vice president for healthy lifestyles. We had a hand in one of the first projects to set up an interactive Web site that lets customers know the exact amounts of fat, sodium and calories in any and all of their products from instant noodles to Chinese fried rice.</br>
Caruso: In still another preemptive move, one of the largest food giants has set up a worldwide panel of advisors consisting of nutritionists and other people outside the company. They'll give advice on new ways to make food.</br>
Takahashi: Nutrition, or the lack of it, affects people of all ages. Based on what I read in the briefing kit, I've outlined a healthful walking campaign similar to one that has proved to be very popular in Japan. In fact, it's at the center of the national government's health program.</br>
Caruso: I'm listening. Tell me more about it.</br>
Takahashi: It promotes brisk walking for health and fitness. Jogging is not encouraged for everybody because it can result in arthritis in the knees as early as middle age, so the focus is on walking as something most people can do at any age.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_04">L03-04</div>
Walker: That makes good sense to me. I see you have a tentative name for the campaign. StepUp. I kind of like that.</br>
Caruso: So do I. First off, we set up a Web site for the campaign. People who are interested can subscribe to the Web site, register and receive a personal ID.</br>
Takahashi: Besides, you can place an order for a pedometer at a special low price. It's not an ordinary pedometer. It has a computer link that lets you connect to the Web site and input the number of steps you've taken each day.</br>
Walker: OK. I see that we need to design and produce a walking kit that can be downloaded. You're suggesting it include maps of walking courses. One of the first that comes to mind is a course in Central Park. Between us, we can probably come up with another dozen in the New York area. I'll look into that in more detail.</br>
Caruso: Should we have a cartoon character as a sort of mascot and campaign spokesperson? That would make the campaign appealing to children as well as grown-ups.</br>
Takahashi: I agree. One idea would be an ostrich, a flightless bird that has to walk to wend its way.</br>
Walker: Good idea. What else do we want to include as incentives? How about competitions? Do we set goals for number of steps per day?</br>

Takahashi: Well the goals in Japan are 9,200 steps for men and 8,300 for women. As for competitions, there's quite a variety, beginning with who took the most steps in a month's time. Our client, as the sponsor, can offer appropriate prizes.</br>
Caruso: Let's see. Food coupons for the client's products are one idea. If we can include some cosponsors, a tie-up with a top producer of footwear for walking would be a natural. Another possible sponsor would be a casual clothing maker.</br>
Walker: We should include a page or two in the kit on the health benefits of walking as daily exercise. We can kick that around with Handan to get the message across that brisk walking is a health benefit for everybody.</br>
Takahashi: Once we map out the campaign and set up the Web site,what's the next move? How do we promote it?</br>
Caruso: That's relatively easy. We set up briefings with packets for the print and broadcast media. We may do an additional event for food media as a special interest group. We keep the door wide open for one-on-one interviews too.</br>
Walker: Shuzo, thanks for coming up with this idea. It's a fun program with tremendous publicity opportunities. I think the client will go for it in a big way.</br>
Takahashi: I'm happy that I could contribute suggestions that shift the campaign into first gear.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L03_06">L03-06</div>
Caruso: We could have customized jackets and T-shirts with the campaign logo and cartoon character that promote the campaign in the process of walking, as well as identifying the wearers as walking prize winners.</br>
Walker: The kit may include a two-pager that zeroes in on the benefits of walking versus jogging. You can flesh out details with Shuzo later, but we want to emphasize that brisk walking pays off for everybody.</br>
Caruso: Got it. Then what should be the next step? How can we publicize it to get maximum mileage out of it?</br>
Walker: TV is the answer. All key media representatives should be invited to the launch press conference. Some of them should be able to get us on TV.</br>
</br>

Dean Reid: We missed you on the bay cruise last night, May. What happened?</br>
Grey: I had to cancel at the last minute. My niece was having hysterics and phoned me at home. She'd opened an odd e-mail attachment, and it instantly infected her computer with the latest Interntvirus.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo: That's bad news. Could you do anything to help her out?</br>
Grey: No, and I told her I'm no longer the free helpline. Every time she needed help, she'd call me. Sometimes I'm stuck on the phone for a couple of hours because she has a new software program she doesn't know how to install or whatever. This time I listened to her long tale of woe and then advised her to go out and get a book. But by then it was too late to join you all.</br>
Susan Caruso: It sounds like a typical example of the new digital divide. The dummies who get into trouble lean on us computer geeks to help them out. Quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of playing the game of computer guru for clueless friends and relatives who can't figure things out on their own.</br>
Grey: I know what you mean. Usually they say it's not their fault they opened an e-mail message and got zapped. They claim it open incoming mail from someone they know.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_02">L04-02</div>
Grey: But if they haven't learned defensive computer skills yet, they're simply the victims of their own ignorance and carelessness. I don't sympathize with that.</br>
Reid: In this day and age, such carelessness is no longer excusable, particularly when it affects other people.</br>
Takahashi: Yeah, it's like trying to drive a car with only a rudimentary idea of how to shift gears or steer or use the brake pedal. It's no wonder that an accident happens. Maybe prospective computer users should be trained and tested to get a license to use a computer.</br>
Grey: I can't say the dummies cause all the problems, though. Software makers need to give us more built-in protection so all of us can feel much more secure. There should be a shared responsibility in that regard.</br>
Caruso: That goes without saying. But how about the old fossils in senior positions at companies that have never embraced the digital revolution? They want nothing to do with computers.</br>
Takahashi: In my old company in Japan, they built an ultramodern boardroom with a computer at each seat. However, because very few of the board members knew how to work on the computer, they had to have an assistant sit next to them and operate the machine for them. To me that's weird.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_03">L04-03</div>
Reid: That kind of technophobia is a barrier to the new frontiers of communication that can make business so much more efficient.</br>
Takahashi: I understand that most of the big companies don't do more than a tenth of what they could do on the Internet. There are so many ways they could do their jobs better if they invested more time in new avenues to communicate ideas and information.</br>
Reid: Yes, the latest automation software can work wonders to monitor and analyze markets, share documents and guarantee quality control.</br>
Caruso: In food marketing, we can tap into numerous databases to help us design and implement successful promotional campaigns for our clients. Brainstorming is important, of course, and so is teamwork. But data is the bedrock for new ideas. Then we can figure out how to manage knowledge or locate experts to lend a helping hand.</br>
Reid: Those of us who interact directly with clients and media are, in effect, spokespersons for Marshall Egler. For that we need to be on our toes and have information at our fingertips. New technologies keep me in touch with corporate values and tools that empower me to represent the company.</br>
Caruso: I keep an eye on baby boomer chat rooms. Boomers are now edging into their 50s, so new markets for gadgets are in the pipeline to ease them into old age.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_04">L04-04</div>
Takahashi: We will soon see software that will assist aging boomers with shopping chores by helping them choose food that conforms to their medical requirements. Food packages will soon have built-in minitransmitters that a scanning device can access to read ingredients and give advice on what's good or not.</br>
Grey: In the year 2030, the last boomers will turn 65 and the number of Americans 65 or older will be double. Boomers will also be the richest group of oldsters ever. They'll be only 20 percent of the population, but they'll have their hands on 40 percent of disposable income. That's the rationale behind the high-tech rush to provide much better care for the elderly.</br>
Reid: Boomers will benefit from numerous innovations that will come with their computer savvy in mind. They will be the first generation of senior people to have fine-tuned computer skills and more money than ever to spend in old age.</br>
Grey: That's one reason so many companies are scrambling to create high-tech aids to cash in on the new trends.</br>
Takahashi: Much the same thing is happening in Japan. We already have toilets that register body weight and body temperature as well as test urine for blood sugar and feces to measure cholesterol counts. That data is fed to their physicians.</br>
Reid: I hear another reason is that nursing homes are shutting down for lack of financing.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_05">L04-05</div>
Reid: Add to that the fact that the baby bust generation is so small there won't be enough younger nurses and other care workers to tend to the boomers.</br>
Takahashi: Boomers are much more like younger grownups than the senior people above them, because they have the Internet in common. The digital generation gap will come to a close.</br>
Caruso: My mother is a case in point. When she doesn't have the access to the Internet for a week or so, she feels lonely and cut off.</br>
Reid: Boomers and younger people are much the same about buying a product online. The main difference is that boomers do a lot of work-related research, but spend much less time on instant messaging or calling up sports scores.</br>
Grey: It's sad to me that my parents never got connected. Computers are a kind of distant foreign country in their estimation. I don't suppose they'll ever log on. They're mission so many good things they could enjoy and profit from if they would only go to computer school and learn some simple skills.</br>
Takahashi: As they say, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. I don't have that problem with my parents. They learned some basic skills by playing computer games with my kids. Now they can't stand to be out of the loop, so at least they keep up with the grandchildren.</br>
Caruso: I'd say that's another great way to bridge the digital divide.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L04_06">L04-06</div>
Takahashi: The situation is similar in Japan, except that the percentage of seniors in the population is rising even faster than here. Some families have their parents' apartments watched by laser to detect movement from the living room to the kitchen to the bathroom. The computer analyses and sends information around the clock.</br>
Reid: Remember those virtual pets from Japan that were all the rage? new digital age variation may create another hit with the seniors.</br>
Takahashi Oh yes. It's an interesting way to remind seniors to take their medicine. Theyle got to use the buttons on the gadget to report they ve taken their pills. If they don't, the pet gets sick and dies.</br>
Reid: Guilt is a great motivator.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_01">L05-01</div>
Ben Walker:Shuzo, as I mentioned, our Japanese client. Kon-Tiki, the maker of soy sauce and other Asian condiments, has decided to hire an American CEO to head their U.S operations. From what I understand he's a hotshot at food marketing but has never worked for a non-US company before.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:I see. May. you said he approached us for a recom- mendation on a job coach. and you volunteered to take on that task. Is there something that I can contribute?</br>
May Grey:I believe you can. In particular, he's concerned about dif- ferences in Japanese and American corporate cultures. I need to know that as well to give him advice and guidance.</br>
Takahashi:Right. He may find the managerial styles quite different. Japanese companies in general are quite paternalistic. Of course, they expect their workers to work very hard. But as much as possible, em- ployees go out together for dinner and drinks to socialize and bolster group ties. Work is often considered the centerpiece of life.</br>
Grey:I tend to admire the Japanese work ethic. But in this country, by comparison, we value our leisure time, home life and individual freedom as well.</br>
Walker:Is it true that all important decisions are made by top manage ment at headquarters in Tokyo and are just handed down?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_02">L05-02</div>
Walker:In other words, how much leeway can this American executive expect to have in terms of personal decision-making?</br>
Takahashi:Well, I don't know the company well enough to give you a precise answer. But in terms of marketing strategies and tactics, I believe he'll have a lot of leeway. He was hired for that kind of expertise. On the other hand, he shouldn't rock the personnel system boat or try to radically change corporate culture. That would be risky, at least in his first 100 days in office.</br>
Grey:I'd agree with you.</br>
Takahashi:When you're ready, I can give you some input on Japanese office politics and etiquette.</br>
Grey:Great. He may need to know that to ensure a harmonious workplace.</br>
Walker:That's another aspect of job coaching. Joining a company as the new manager can be a recipe for headaches. If you're inclined to be too roughshod or to push your staff people too hard or too fast, they may retaliate with the silent treatment, a sort of superficial harmony</br>
Grey:The main reason why so many companies are turning to outside job coaches is to ease new managers into new positions with a minimum of friction.</br>
Takahashi:Your coaching session in the first week I was on board here was a godsend for me, May.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_03">L05-03</div>
Takahashi:I learned the first steps to winning acceptance from co- workers in a very different business environment. Actually. I was surprised that everyone was so friendly.</br>
Grey:They wanted you to feel right at home right away. That attitude alone can mean the difference between comfort and conflict. You made friends, not enemies, so you won their willingness to let you settle in comfortably and then contribute to teamwork. In the end, it wasn't my guidance that did the trick. You did it with your affable attitude.</br>
Walker:has professional credentials from the international coach organization based here. The client can expect the best.</br>
May Takahashi:Other than dealing with cross-cultural and settling-in issues, what does a job coach do?</br>
Grey:Broadly speaking, we have pep talks that can cover leadership problems, time management, goal setting and interpersonal skills at work. The dialogues are usually done outside of work hours at a comfortable coffee shop for an hour or two. Sometimes the issues that come up can be painful for the client. We work on them as well.</br>
Walker:In that sense, coaches walk a thin line between coaching and psychotherapy. Job coaching has become a booming business. Many companies consider it a key management tool.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_04">L05-04</div>
Grey:The main hurdle is choosing a competent job coach. It's a business that is not regulated, so you could get stuck with a lemon.</br>
Walker:That's the leading reason why Kon-Tiki asked us for a re. commendation. Luckily, we could recommend with no reser vations.</br>
May Takahashi:If an executive needs some career coaching and has to seek out a coach on his own, how would he go about doing that?</br>
Grey:One way is to contact the international coach organization for information on coaching services in your area. They suggest interviewing at least three coaches before you choose one.</br>
Walker:It's also a good idea to choose a coach who is familiar with the subject you want to work on, say, a career switch, for instance. Ask pertinent questions and get reliable replies based on the coach's own background. Has he or she coached other people in the same kind of situation? How much time was spent on coaching in the past year?</br>
Grey:Yes, you're right, Ben. I've been asked about my business background quite apart from coaching. Experience is the best teacher. Have I experienced a career switch? If so, how did I cope?</br>
Walker:That kind of bonding opens up a dialogue right away.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_05">L05-05</div>
Grey:Another good tip may be to ask how many people they coached over the past year. Also, ask for some of those clients' names and arrange to talk to them. If that's not possible because that information is confidential, ask for the coach's references instead. Just like some of our own clients who ask for our client references and samples of past work.</br>
Takahashi:Is job coaching popular?</br>
Grey:No doubt about that. It's growing by leaps and bounds. According to one newsletter I receive, one-fifth of the psychiatrists in the United States are doing job coaching too. That's another indicator of how fast it's catching on.</br>
Walker:I've got a new wrinkle at home. My teenage son is learning time management skills to cope with his high school workload. He's gota color-coded system to keep track of his class assignments and a day planner to get things done on schedule. That's some of what career coaches handle.</br>
Takahashi:I can see how that would give him a competitive edge in his class work. He must be an exceptional student.</br>
Walker:Excellent but not necessarily exceptional. Geometry gives him trouble, so for that he has an outside mathematics tutor who gets paid from his allowance. He's already learning organizational skills that will stand him in good stead in whatever line of work he chooses later on.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L05_06">L05-06</div>
Walker: Is it not true that all key decisions are made by the top brass in Japan? Isn't he going to be just a figurehead?</br>
Takahashi: It depends. Some Japanese companies were like that in the past. But we're seeing a sea change in the younger generation of workers.</br>
Walker: I understand that due to the economic doldrums in Japan, many companies have abandoned their policies of lifetime job security to cut costs in the struggle to survive.</br>
Takahashi: That's right. In reaction to that, young workers don't feel any lifetime commitment to one company. Moreover, they envy the American lifestyle with its devotion to spending quality time with families.</br>
</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_01">L06-01</div>
Dean Reid:I'll bet all hell broke loose at Cronin Brothers this morning. Their CEO was dumb enough to circulate a snarling and sarcastic e-mail message urging the company's employees to "milk" their clients or get fired.</br>
Susan Caruso:I wonder who leaked the message to the media. It sure got prominent exposure with the bulk of the message quoted. There were threats of layoffs and hiring freezes and a shutdown of the employee health club if corporate performance doesn't improve. He said he was only trying to crack the whip on his troops, though.</br>
Reid:I think the CEO will probably have to step down. He broke two cardinal rules for modern managers: a) never try to hold large-scale discussions by e-mail, and b) never, ever use the company e-mail system to convey sensitive information or controversial ideas to more than a handful of trusted lieutenants.</br>
Caruso:The more costly error was releasing such a juicy, provocative memo to the whole workforce-around 13,000 associates, I understand. That's practically inviting recipients to relay it to friends or even the competition.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:I never assume that my e-mail will be read only by the people I send it to. The smartest hackers know how to circumvent computer firewalls.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_02">L06-02</div>
Caruso:Nowadays, managers shouldn't use e-mail to discuss major issues or to circulate sensitive information, such as potential M&A. The whole world may be looking over your shoulder. Any smart company knows how important it is to have each and every employee and board member understand the do's and don'ts of communicating by computer.</br>
Reid:That's for sure. You have to ask yourself what impression your message will make if it's printed in a newspaper. Today's media report is precisely a case in point. I feel sorry for every living soul at Cronin Brothers except the knucklehead who sent that message. He deserves to take a tumble to the bottom of the heap.</br>
Caruso:That could happen if he's prosecuted. At first, everyone thought e-mail would make work and play so much easier. It didn't occur to anyone that lawyers and law courts would take a different view. As it turned out, e-mail is now a prosecutor's topmost provider of evidence for filing a suit against a careless company.</br>
Reid:In that sense, the content of e-mail messages must be considered the same as any form of written correspondence on company statio- nery.</br>
Caruso:E-mail is a double-edged sword. Companies can't live without it if they want to stay on the fast track,</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_03">L06-03</div>
Caruso:But it can be turned around to cut them down.</br>
Takahashi:That's true. Even if you press the "delete" key, your e-mail isn't vaporized. It's still on the computer's hard drive and can be retrieved, reconstructed and submitted as evidence of a crime.</br>
Reid:In accordance with MarshEg policy, we're required to either archive or purge all e-mail on a quarterly basis. Purging allows the company to free up server space for more productive uses. But purges don't eliminate the ones that people print out and file away and don't eradicate the e-mail that has been sent out, to say nothing of the messages that are stored on individual computers.</br>
Caruso:Some e-mail can be of benefit to employees or employers caught up in a lawsuit. Remember the case of the giant U.S. investment bank last month that faced a court case from former employees? They filed a sexual harassment suit against the bank. A court-ordered scan of the company's e-mail system turned up only a couple of jokes that could be considered racy. The bank successfully defended themselves as a result.</br>
Reid:That's because they had a good e-mail policy in place. The bank showed that they took steps to prevent inappropriate use of the e-mail system and therefore were found free of liability. They also took prompt remedial action against the worker who'd sent the sexually offensive e-mail.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_04">L06-04</div>
Takahashi:In general, what's considered offensive?</br>
Caruso:Well. our e-mail policy states that the system should notbe used for the creation or distribution of any messages containing inappropriate comments about race, gender, age, sexual orientation, pornography, religious or political beliefs, national origin or disabilit</br>
Reid:There's another way to nip trouble in the bud. As you know, we're soon going to install monitoring software for all internal and external e-mail. Compliance monitors scan outgoing messages in advance and rewrite or give warning with relevant comments.</br>
Takahashi:Yes, I read that in the house journal and was frankly quite surprised. Is it legal, and doesn't it violate the employees' rights to privacy? It sounds a bit Orwellian to me.</br>
Caruso:More than half of American corporations engage in this practice now. Court cases have shown that if the employer has warned the employees beforehand that their e-mail might be monitored without prior warning, the employer has a right to do so. Again, it's important for the company to have a formal e-mail policy and to include the warning</br>
Reid:The best way to monitor e-mail is to automatically block or quarantine messages before they are sent or received.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_05">L06-05</div>
Reid:That kind of software also can protect the system from viruses and spam messages.</br>
Caruso:Training classes for employees are just as important. We help in-house users to send effective e-mail by informing them of best practices and explain that offensive jokes and remarks can be much more harmful than they seem. We also stress that employees who witness abuse of the e-mail system must report this to their supervisors.</br>
Reid:They can't know what they can or can't do in line with company policy if they're not trained. So we have a training session every year.</br>
Caruso:Another thing we advise is not to make excessive use of the company e-mail facility for sending or receiving personal e-mail. You shouldn't pass on messages containing jokes, pictures, greeting cards or other similar attachments and should discourage external contacts from sending such materials. The new software will automatically delete them, though.</br>
Reid:It's a defense mechanism. But we also get updates on new tech- nologies which may outpace e-mail.</br>
Takahashi:It's a strange new world we inhabit with technology changing our lives at what seems nigh on light-speed. I can understand why we need strict regulation of what we communicate to keep our hands squeaky clean.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L06_06">L06-06</div>
Takahashi: Some of our people might resent the new rules that crack down on personal e-mail sent to friends at client companies or to other business associates.</br>
Reid: Monitors would reject personal messages that included jokes, pictures, greeting cards or other frivolous attachments. If it's incoming mail, monitors will delete it immediately.</br>
Takahashi: My eyes were opened when I tried to download some free software to visit a certain work-related Web site. The monitor warned me to get company clearance for that in advance, because a computer virus might sneak in with a piece of unvetted software. Forewarned. I'm forearmed.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_01">L07-01</div>
Dean Reid:It was such a cool idea, Susan, to suggest that we come out to Napa Valley to get an update on what's happening in the world of slo food.</br>
Susan Caruso:Well, it was good of to buy the idea and send us. We have ample time for discussion as the organic turkeys roast over the open fire here in the winery. Look, the sun's setting on distant grape vines. How beautiful it is!</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:Yeah. Everything's so different from the hustle and bustle of New York. But let's not forget we've got to sort out our notes and report to our fast food clients.</br>
Caruso:I was under the impression that the slow food movement started in California. But, in fact, it was pioneered in Italy, close to 20 years ago.</br>
Takahashi:That's our next destination. IChuckles] I heard it was spurred by a negative reaction to the spread of fast food and in opposition to corporate farming.</br>
Reid:The movement in Italy and now is an outgrowth of the original organic food revolution that first sprang to life in California. Most people thought that organic food farming was just another one of those California fads that don't last long.</br>
Caruso:They shrugged it off as a fringe market. Now we see mos grocery stores stocking organic foods.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_02">L07-02</div>
Caruso:Our tour of the organic creamery was quite an eye-opener. It's small in scale, with fewer than 40 workers, but it sells over 25 million pounds of organic milk in a year at a price much higher than major milk brands. That threw me for a loop.</br>
Takahashi:Me too. As we found out, slow food is not only slow in cook- ing and eating. Producing it is a slow process as well. It's fresh food produced at small farms for local consumption and usually sold at small stores or to neighborhood restaurants</br>
Caruso:It's not a big business and doesn't want to be. Even so, slow food cookbooks are hot sellers. Celebrity chefs are giving slow foods-rice oysters, cheeses, turkeys and so on-star treatment. Two major grocery chains that champion slow food have doubled their annual sales in the past five years.</br>
Reid:From another perspective, seeing how slow food is cooked is quite an experience.</br>
Caruso:As our chef said, a good meal should include ample time for wining and dining pleasure. What's the fun in rushing through it? They're also getting really creative with orgamie id rice and vege tables.</br>
Reid:I asked where organic wild rice comes from and was to be told it comes from the Great Lakes.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_03">L07-03</div>
Reid:A tribe of Native Americans harvests the rice in canoes and then dries it over wood fires while telling traditional stories. It sells for four times the price of wild rice in the supermarket. Even so, thousands of pounds are snapped up every year by chefs who adore it for its organic character.</br>
Takahashi:One question that came to my mind is the consumer market for slow food. Who likes it?</br>
Caruso:I picked up some data that gives a fairly good profile. Slow food lovers are typically college graduates with higher than average incomes. Somehow that doesn't surprise me. People of much the same profile led off the fight for women's rights and other cutting-edge social trends.</br>
Reid:A much broader consumer base will raise demand for slow food that, in turn, should induce suppliers to bring prices down, creating even more consumer demand in the long run.</br>
Takahashi:That'll be great. But here and now, in addition to the cook-outs, we know that this winery throws an annual bash for its avocado and artichoke growers, welcoming steady customers as well. I asked for a copy of the poster and got one. Too bad we won't be here for this year's event.</br>
Reid:Don't be too sure about that. We could twist Ben's arm a month or two in advance.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_04">L07-04</div>
Reid:He loves avocados and artichoke hearts. If we visit a California farm, we may need to keep him on a leash. [Laughter]</br>
Caruso:In the meantime, let's see if we can reach some tentative conclusions. The biggest question is this one: Is slow food a growing threat to fast food? That's what our clients want to know.</br>
Takahashi:Based on what we've seen and heard so far, my immediate answer is no. Slow food is an outgrowth of the organic food re- volution, but for the moment its appeal is limited to a tiny minority who have enough leisure time and the income to afford it. To the average married couple raising kids and struggling to make ends meet, slow food is something up in the stratosphere.</br>
Reid:I see what you mean. They can't possibly afford to pay for a quart of organic milk at three times the price of ordinary store-bought milk. What's more, with so many American couples holding down double jobs to feed and clothe the family, how many can afford to spend the time and money needed for slow meals?</br>
Caruso:OK. One point is to stress the price difference. Fast food is quick and cheap. Slow food is not. Only a relatively small number of people with above-average incomes can afford to indulge regularly in slow food.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_05">L07-05</div>
Takahashi:I don't think fast and slow foods compete. If anything, they're complementary. If you're in a hurry on a hectic workday, gobble down fast food. If you've got time to sit back and relax in good company, go for the slow.</br>
Reid:As we know, the toughest competition eating into standard fast food's market share comes from the new sandwich chains that customize orders. Do you want your roast beef on rye, pita or white bread? What's your favorite topping for the cherry tomato salad? How about vinegar dressing or blue cheese? Does your calorie count allow sweet cream today on your apple tart?</br>
Caruso:The service time is a bit slower and the cost a trifle higher, but people are willing to wait and pay extra pennies for such made-to-order meals. More traditional fast food chains, including our clients, serve the standard cheeseburger and fries, and that's that.</br>
Takahashi:Well, there is a plus side to that. People can order the cheese burger and know exactly what to expect, because it's always the same. In fact, that's why lots of people like it. However, I think our clients need to add some options to fend off the threat of those very competitive sandwich chains. Instead of fries all the time, how about a choice of fries or a scoop of potato salad? Now there's some food for thought.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L07_06">L07-06</div>
Reid: Now that we've sorted out our notes, let's review what we've learned about the slow food movement. Our first interview with the chef at the slow food restaurant in Sonoma turned up some startling facts.</br>
Caruso: You're telling me. I thought the movement had started out here in America, mainly New York in the East, and in the West here in California, centered largely around San Francisco.</br>
Reid: We all assumed that. But it was surprising to find that it actually started in Italy, beginning in a small village. Now slow food is an international phenomenon. It has a worldwide association with 75,000 members, including 70 chapters in more than 40 U.S. states.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_01">L08-01</div>
Takahashi Shuzo:There was a report on the news this morning that said millions of Americans are stressed out from overwork. I thought American workers knew how to strike a balance between work and leisure.</br>
May Grey:Here at MarshEg. top management puts a high priority on balancing work and leisure. Our corporate culture is dead set against all work and no play because of the clear danger of burnout.</br>
Ben Walker:That's not the case with far too many private companies and government agencies that opt to keep costs down by minimizing the number of employees and therefore maximizing workloads. Millions of Americans work harder than people in any other industrial nation.</br>
Takahashi:I see. The report did mention that mandatory overtime with no extra pay is at record levels. What's more, Americans work nearly nine weeks longer each year than the average worker in Western Europe.</br>
Grey:That's true. We have about two weeks of vacation in a year. Europeans enjoy vacations that average five or six weeks.</br>
Walker:Several years ago, we were horrified at reports about karoshi, or death from overwork, in the Japanese workforce. We should take a good look in the mirror.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_02">L08-02</div>
Walker:Millions of us are risking our health and even our lives.</br>
Grey:Overwork is not only a health concern. Constant fatigue can impai alertness to the point of causing accidents and injuries.</br>
Takahashi:It can also ruin families. I've seen that happen in Japan, so it must be happening here in much the same way. There's no quality time at home. People are too stressed out to care about each other. All they want is a chance for scant sleep after the daily grind.</br>
Grey:It's bad for communities too. There's no time to hang out with neighbors or to get involved in community affairs as volunteers. You get to be like a hamster frantically running on a spinning wheel, day in, day out. Taalasti There should be more to liethan producing and consuning You only live once. Why are people so obsessed with work? Why do people let it override health, happy family life and a host of other things they need to care about?</br>
Grey:On the other hand. I don't want things to go overboard. Quite honestly. I wouldn't want to have five or six weeks of vacation in a year. Two or three weeks are fine by me. More than that would drive me crazy, having nothing much to do.</br>
Walker:You're right, May. I'm not really a workaholic. I'm a lousy vacationer. On top of that, I simply love the work I do.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_03">L08-03</div>
Walker:Hanging around at home with too much time on my hands gives me no joy. It was different when the kids were little. It was fun to somewhere and play together. Now they're in their teens and want to go to summer camps and hang out with their friends.</br>
Takahashi:My kids are in grade school and look forward to family travel. This summer we're planning to drive up the coast to Acadia National Park in Maine with a lot of stops along the way. We're all looking forward to exploring the Atlantic coastline.</br>
Grey:Well. enjoy your children while they're young because they grow up all too quickly, and you'll eventually be left with an empty nest.</br>
Walker:Vacations are supposed to give you a chance to relax in peace and quiet, but instead have the opposite effect. They're wasted on me. They generate stress, and I get grim and grouchy. And think of the dread of returning to a pile of accumulated work. The cubicle doesn't seem like the worst daily destination to me. I yearn to be back in the office most of the time I'm on vacation.</br>
Takahashi:I hadn't considered that, but some of my new neighbors don't take vacations at all because it's too risky to be away from their desks in the midst of workplace layoffs. They worry that a vacation could become permanent. On top of that, a week off also means a double or triple workload piled up on their desks.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_04">L08-04</div>
Grey:In this country, a vacation is not considered a right but a privilege. It's no wonder that American workers hesitate to take even two weeks of vacation time.</br>
Walker:The current buzzword is "presenteeism," which happens when people are afraid to call in sick. Instead, they show up, but are still to0 ill or stressed out to be productive. A lot of people believe it's better to show up even if you're far less than 100 percent productive.</br>
Grey:An amazing 12 percent of the American workforce doesn't take any time off at all. More take only a part of what they're entitled to. The leading reason-guilt. Somehow, there's a cloud of guilt about having fun when so many fellow workers have their noses to the grindstone the year round.</br>
Walker:Besides, things have gotten worse now that technology makes you available all the time. You're expected to work even when you're out of the office. And you never really feel out of the office.</br>
Takahashi:It sounds like a cultural dilemma. I don't want to sound like an armchair psychoanalyst, but maybe it's a matter of mixed feelings. On the one hand, everyone needs time for rest and recreation. On the other hand, aren't you letting the side down when you're not hard at work for a week or two?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_05">L08-05</div>
Grey:There's a grain of truth in that. In a lackluster economy, most corporate cultures oblige us to be overworked, overtired and overstressed. When you look around, that seems to be the norm these days. Taking time off for leisure and pleasure is a cardinal sin. We're supposed to be busting our butts for home and country.</br>
Walker:That's one way to cope, I suppose, but I don't buy into it. For me, work is play. Now and then, if I feel stressed, I close my office door, sit back and have a catnap for five or ten minutes. Then I feel refreshed and ready to get to work again. Pablo Picasso once said, gWhen I work I relax. Doing nothing or entertaining visitors makes me tired." I feel much the same way</br>
Takahashi:I don't catnap, because I might doze off for half an hour. I stand up and give myself some mild aerobic exercise like running in place to recharge the batteries. May, how do you cope when you feel overloaded?</br>
Grey:Ibrew a cup of pekoe tea and sit by the window to see what's happening in the park across the street. Usually there's somebody tractions like that are restful for me. mming a guitar or scattering seeds for the pigeons to eat. Dis:</br>
Walker:Taking short breaks in the busiest days helps anyone keep healthy and happy</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L08_06">L08-06</div>
Walker: A new movement sprang up a couple of years ago calling for people to take back your time." It's not opposed to work. but advocates a healthy balance betweem work and play.</br>
Takahashi If it wakes people up to the dangers of chronic overwork. it's a good start, but what happens after that? How can it raise a groundswell of public opinion to the point that actions speak louder than words?</br>
Walkers Thats a point will takem. How we go about it is ily. We may all agree that something has to be done. The question is how? Do we push for federal government legislation to Eghten workloads? Would we rather ask for tax relief for hard-pressed workers?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_01">L09-01</div>
Takahashi Shuzo:and I were invited to a gala event last night in celebration of the 85th birthdays of three doyens of the public relations profession.</br>
Susan Caruso:It sure was some party. They're the founding fathers of our business, so to speak, and are as spry as ever, and all come to work every day. I was quite impressed by them.</br>
Takahashi:So was I. Their speeches were thoughtful and witty too. One of them, quoting Ernest Hemingway, said, "Retirement is the ugliest word in the English language." He likes the business so much that he would never retire if he could avoid it.</br>
May Grey:That sounds like Ben's speech when he gets to 85. But it's true that the hottest trend to watch in the job market today is how to bring older workers back from retirement.</br>
Takahashi:From what I gather, there's a rising demand for rehiring retirees or keeping them on past retirement age because their skills experience and hardworking habits are much in demand.</br>
Grey:But then, there's the generation gap at the opposite end of the spectrum. You know, the baby boom ers versus Generation Xers.</br>
Caruso:Sure. There is quite a gap in attitude. Boomers live to work, but Xers only work to live, as they say. There's not much middle ground.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_02">L09-02</div>
Grey:Nearly 80 million boomers are present-day or potential employees, I read recently.</br>
Takahashi:That's quite a pool to choose from. Businesses in retail and healthcare are especially keen to keep older workers or bring them back on board.</br>
Grey:Workers 55 and up are favored by companies that look ahead to the next 10 or 20 years. The job market for senior workers now accounts for well over two percent of the whole workforce</br>
Caruso:I understand there is also a cost benefit for employers. Average employee turnover in businesses is nine to ten percent, but it's much lower for senior employees. Last year alone, the job market increased by five percent for senior workers but was flat for younger people.</br>
Takahashi:foresees a widening generation gap over the next 10 years. He figures that the job market for senior workers will continue to increase by something like four to five percent per year, in other words, by four times as much as the whole workforce.</br>
Ben Grey:He's right, and there are a couple of other factors involved. A lot of senior workers can't afford to retire. They have to stay on the job for one employer or another.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_03">L09-03</div>
Grey:Put simply, they need the money. Some weren't able to save enough for a comfortable old age. Others saw the value of their investment portfolios shrink with the long slump in the stock market.</br>
Takahashi:And I'll bet some of them, like my grandfather, can't stand to stay home and sit in a rocking chair. They keep on working because they enjoy it.</br>
Caruso:I can understand that. Most working people, including last night's octogenarians, feel good when they're needed and useful. Are there people who don't share that feeling?</br>
Grey:There is a general fear that Generation Xers, who feel at home with the digital culture, may not share the boomers' work ethic. The generation gap may set off an escalating clash of values that could lead to warfare in the workplace.</br>
Caruso:Actually, Shuzo, there are four generations involved. We have oldest group of workers dating from the World War II generation. Next we have the baby boomers. Just below them we have Generation X, and in the youngest category, Generation Y.</br>
Grey:That's right. Every one of the four generations has different sets of values, different outlooks and different kinds of stereotypes they buy into.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_04">L09-04</div>
Grey:As the remainder of the oldest group of workers bows out of the workforce, the boomers will take the top position. It's a huge generation that virtually worships the work ethic.</br>
Caruso:In other words, working hard and earning an honest living is what self esteem is all about.</br>
Takahashi:I'm beginning to get the picture. The counterpart generation in Japan is much the same. Work comes first and foremost. Everything else is secondary.</br>
Caruso:Generation X doesn't put the work ethic on an altar. Of course. work is important to provide for their families and other costs of living. but that's as far as it goes.</br>
Grey:In other words, they are much less ambitious in terms of career building. In a business crisis, the boomers will volunteer to bail a company out of trouble more than willingly, even if it comes down to considerable wage or salary cuts. Xers will resist income cuts to the hilt and only grudgingly put in extra work hours or whatever to keep a company afloat. If the crisis continues, they're likely to bail out and head off for what they believe are greener pastures.</br>
Takahashi:I see. The mindsets are quite different. In Japan, lifelong loyalty to a company used to be taken for granted.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_05">L09-05</div>
Takahashi:That's not so nowadays, especially in the generation equivalent to Generation X. Traditional loyalty is a thing of the past because there's no real feeling of job security. Iob-hopping from company to company to climb the corporate ladder isn't unique to America.</br>
Grey:Some of us in human resources don't see a tidal wave of Xers toppling the hard-work ethic and the future American economy. We're well aware of the differences involved, but in fact, Generation X is much smaller than the boomer population. If we keep the boomers working hard and happy for the next 10 to 20 years, the Xers can't cause much trouble.</br>
Caruso:In effect, they're contending with a glass ceiling as long as the boomers choose to stay in place. Added to that, the job market for new college graduates is the worst I can remember.</br>
Grey:Go to any fast food outlet and notice the number of senior workers They're taking jobs that used to go exclusively to young people.</br>
Caruso:All is not lost for the youngsters, however. and other human resources managers are letting senior managers know what they'll have to contend with in the next 10 years or so,</br>
May Takahashi:That's a step in the right direction. Good managers always have to be on the bal o understand what makes their working peoale tick, in any generation.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L09_06">L09-06</div>
Takahashi: As a rule, senior managers in Japan shy away from computers. They count on much younger colleagues to deal with that. On the other hand, the young employees give them headaches because they constantly demand to have better on-the-job harde and software.</br>
Grey: It's much the same here. Ben and other senior managers certains struggled to learn the basics of using a computer, but don't want to much beyond that. Dean, on the other handis constantly camering for the newest models on the market and the most sophisticated software.</br>
Takahashi: I guess that's another manifestation of the generation gap.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_01">L10-01</div>
Takahashi Shuzo:This overview and update that Grey did on job discrimination lawsuits is fascinating. I had no idea that people can and do sue companies for not hiring them because they're too fat, skinny, homely or whatever.</br>
Susan Caruso:A cousin of mine is a case in point. He went to a job fair and was offered a job with a Tex-Mex fast food chain-you know, tacos, tortillas, chili, refried beans--and he was hired. When he showed up at the soon-to-open outlet with other new recruits, he was asked his size for a uniform</br>
Ben Walker:I've met him at Susan's parties once or twice. He's very large and must weigh 100 pounds. As the story goes, he waited a month or so, heard nothing, and called to find out when he could start working. He was told that his uniform pants weren't ready. He kept on asking and kept on getting the same runaround.</br>
Caruso:He finally went to the outlet for a friendly chat with the manager, who refused to see him. However, he did see that other people who'd been hired with him were behind the counter, and not wearing uniform pants, just smocks. At that point, he blew his stack, talked to a lawyer and decided to file a suit for disability discrimination based on his body weight.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_02">L10-02</div>
Walker:There is no specific law that forbids employers from discriminating against people in terms of their appearance. A lawsuit has to be based on other factors, such as discrimination due to disability, age or gender to stand a chance of succeeding in court.</br>
Caruso:That's why he filed suit by claiming his weight as a disability,</br>
Takahashi:As noted, if you need thin women as fashion models, rotund women can't expect to get hired, and that's not considered to be discrimination under the law.</br>
May Walker:Another study that caught my eye was a survey showing short young men and heavy young women in England are paid less on average than taller or thinner colleagues. The same was true for workers who were less attractive than average.</br>
Takahashi:On the other hand, a survey of sales managers indicates that good appearance matters for salespeople. Turnoffs for customers include sloppy or poor-style clothing, unattractive faces and overweight bodies as well as heavy foreign accents or looking too young</br>
Caruso:That last one grabs me. Too young?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_03">L10-03</div>
Caruso:We've got hordes of middle-aged or older executives trying to look younger by resorting to cosmetic surgery. They claim they've been on two week Caribbean skin-diving cruises when they come back to the office with no bags under their eyes or deep lines around their mouths.</br>
Walker:To those of us in the know, it's clear they don't look younger because they've been in salt water. They've been under a plastic surgeon's knife for a facelift and had their gray hair dyed or bald spots covered with hair transplants.</br>
Takahashi:I thought looking old was an asset for senior executives. It implied you were wise, highly skilled and deeply experienced. It looks like that's not the case nowadays. I suppose signs of older age, even for executives in their 40s and 50s, makes them feel insecure about keeping their jobs.</br>
Caruso:I very much doubt that they're in real danger. As you know. there's an increasing trend for companies to retain senior employees. It's cheaper and more efficient than replacing them with younger and untrained workers.</br>
Walker:Consider the sums of money they're spending to preserve the illusion of youth. Eyelid surgery costs $1,500 on average, facelifts $20,000</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_04">L10-04</div>
Walker:In addition, it's risky. People have suffered from complications in simple chin-tuck operations.</br>
Takahashi:Still and all the statistics on age bias tell a different story Another survey of senior executives that cites discovered that over 80 percent are deeply concerned about age bias. Men are as afraid of it as women, not only in senior management, but even in middle management.</br>
May Caruso:I find the surgical breakdown interesting. The stats for men have doubled over the last 10 years. However, men don't talk about cosmetic surgery: Mum is the word. If coworkers comment on their appearance. they say vacations can work wonders.</br>
Walker:Unlike women, men don't have the advantage of makeup, but they can age better. I think. Their skin is thicker and daily shaving rejuvenates the skin. What surprised me was that both sexes want to frown lines between their eyebrows or on their foreheads. Nobody wants to look worried.</br>
Takahashi:I might be worried if didn't have frown lines. [Laughter] I mean it. To me, frown lines indicate deep concern, deep concentration and deep commitment to get good work done.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_05">L10-05</div>
Ben Walker:I'm inclined to take that as a compliment even if I don't like to see frown lines in my mirror. Anyway, I'm not inclined to take aging seriously. I'll take it graciously. Far be it from me to seem so young that I look wet behind the ears. [Laughter]</br>
Caruso:I don't know that I can be so complacent about the first sign of wrinkles beside my eyes. Even so, I'm not very hot on facelifts. Old wrinkles disappear, but new wrinkles appear elsewhere. I once read about a movie actress who had so many facelifts that finally her skin was so tight she couldn't smile. Who wants to end up like that?</br>
Takahashi:I know I don't. Lines are signs of maturity. Why hide that? The conclusion drawn in May's report is that visible aging is no big deal. There are far more important issues for middle and senior managers to consider.</br>
Walker:She does make the point that looking younger is a superficial way of contending with ageism. The real crux of the matter is that managers need to rejuvenate their thinking. They need to stay up-to-date on current events and what's happening in popular culture as well as business culture.</br>
Caruso:I agree. If you think and act like an old fogy trapped in the past, you don't stand much chance of career advancement.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L10_06">L10-06</div>
Takahashi: I've just read a book by a career coach who doesn't give athumbs-down to skin treatments. However, he emphasizes that a wide variety of reading and chatting with people in different profession helps to keep him mentally refreshed and healthful. That has the ring of truth to me.</br>
Walker: It doesn't matter so much how old you are. It's your attitude that counts most. The kinds of people I like most are passionate at work and play. They exude enthusiasm on and off the job. They care about what's going on in the world and what they can do about it. </br>
Takahashi: We all need to be on the ball as business executives in order to do our jobs in the modern-day world.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_01">L11-01</div>
Takahashi Shuzo:I haven't seen in the office the past couple of days. Is he sick or something?</br>
May Grey:His father suffered a mild heart attack over the weekend, and he's back with his family in Utah.</br>
Takahashi:Oh, I hadn't heard. I hope things work out well for him and his family.</br>
Susan Caruso:So do I. You know. Shuzo, he's part of the sandwich generation that gets chewed on at both ends.</br>
Takahashi:What do you mean by the "sandwich generation?"</br>
Caruso:I mean the generation of people still raising their children while having to care for their aging parents. is one of them. Ben's in the same boat. He's just about finished with his kids, but must now take care of his sick parents. Most of the baby boomers belong to that generation.</br>
Dean Grey:Only now are social agencies beginning to recognize that this generation needs help to cope with the housing, financial, medical and emotional problems of their parents, as well as with their own guilt and resentment.</br>
Takahashi:So boomers need to get their lives into a better balance between work and other values, including family time.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_02">L11-02</div>
Takahashi:I hear priorities are beginning to shift accordingly, but don't we all want to put priority on our personal values rather than on company values?</br>
Caruso:Sure, that's quite natural. Companies need to focus on employee welfare to keep their people healthy and happy in both the short and long run, along with their corporate goals. That's the basic way to maximize productivity.</br>
Grey:There are other pressures. While millions of Americans can't get jobs, the millions who are employed are forced to put in overtime to keep their jobs. They have no other choice.</br>
Caruso:On average, U.S. workers are putting in nearly 2,000 hours a year. That has led to harmful effects. For example, stress due to overwork has an impact on immune systems that can trigger heart disease. Too much fattening food and little, if any, healthy exercise have set off an epidemic of diabetes and obesity.</br>
Grey:Workers with children don't have much time to spend with their kids. Too much overtime lowers workers' productivity. Work as such sn't bad. Doing a good job contributes to health and self-esteem. However, when work time gets out of balance, you may be at high risk of burnout or worse.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_03">L11-03</div>
Takahashi:Sometimes I feel pressured to meet deadlines, but it's not a constant pressure. I have ample time in the evenings and on weekends to spend with my kids. I even help them with their homework. Their English is improving by leaps and bounds, but schoolwork in a second language is still a constant challenge.</br>
Grey:Still and all that you're there and that you care to lend a hand is what matters most. Since I'm a single parent, it's never easy for me to balance work time and child time. I manage as best I can.</br>
Takahashi:I understand that some female executives are dropping out of good jobs to stay home as wives and mothers. They feel it's more important than fat paychecks and professional prestige.</br>
Grey:Maybe they have enough money saved for rainy days. But I know that almost three-quarters of working mothers can't afford to quit their jobs. How can they hope for a better balance in a workaholic world?</br>
Takahashi:When I hear that 70 percent of American workers complain that there isn't a healthy balance between work and personal life, an alarm bell goes off in my mind.</br>
Caruso:Most people, men and women alike, want to work and nurture families.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_04">L11-04</div>
Caruso:But bringing up children and pursuing upward careers have never been easily balanced. Both demand hard work from fathers as well as mothers. Maybe the biggest challenge of all is how each of us can work out personal ways to reach a balance that works.</br>
Grey:One way to do it is a job search for a supportive workplace. That's why I decided to work here when a headhunter came to me. came later. We're both dual-centric people. We balance work demands and family needs as equal priorities. It's kind of like riding a seesaw with one side or the other on the upswing, as circumstances demand.</br>
Susan Takahashi:That didn't occur to me the first couple of months I worked here. Then I began to notice that Susan, and even practiced their own versions of flextime as seen on the office bulletin board. goes to afternoon PTA meetings. occasionally comes in late when his wife can't drive the kids to school. pops out for an hour to attend his calisthenics class.</br>
Ben Caruso:By now you've also noticed that work gets done on schedule anyway. Flextime is used but not abused. There are times when weekends have to be sacrificed for local business meetings or flights to distant cities.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_05">L11-05</div>
Caruso:However, I always consider raising the roof if it means I'll miss a school play or field day on Saturday or Sunday.</br>
Grey:and I see eye to eye on keeping weekends for high priority family time. That doesn't mean we're negligent about groaning work- loads. I'll put in extra time on my laptop at home if need be, but the point is that I'm at home when I'm supposed to be there. I take breaks to spend quality time with my daughter.</br>
Susan Takahashi:I'm getting the general idea, but I don't know if I can cope with it. My brain is wired for working 9 to 5 at my desk, apart from a company conference, outside business meeting or, of course, a short lunch break.</br>
Caruso:In other words, you're contending with an ingrained work ethic that won't quit. Try playing with flextime in baby steps. In due course. you'll come to understand how it works to your advantage, not only to prioritize your time, but also to keep you in shape for great performance on the job.</br>
Grey:In other words, Shuzo, you're the boss. I assume that you truly enjoy the work you're doing here. That's another high priority for men as well as women.</br>
Takahashi:There's no doubt that I'm having a ball here. It doesn't feel like work. It's a game that I can play with zest.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L11_06">L11-06</div>
Caruse: I left my former company because I was headed for a nervous breakdown. I sat down with the manager and said that if the company valued my strengths and my talents. I needed the freedom to split my time evenly between work and my family.</br>
Grey: In effect, you were testing the water to find out if the company would take your personal priorities into account.</br>
Caruse: Yes, but the manager's response was a snorted "no." I handed　in my resignation the next morning. Then a close friend who worked　here suggested I call you. I did so and was hired.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_01">L12-01</div>
Susan Caruso:What did you guys think of Ben's lament about Lisa, his oldest daughter?</br>
Dean Reid:I could empathize. I had a similar problem lining up a job in my senior year at college.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:I can understand that is very concerned that Lisa can't land a job.</br>
Ben Reid:It isn't for lack of effort. Lisa spent her entire summer looking for opportunities, but nothing bubbled up. She did do a bunch of job interviews, but got no offers. That's odd because there are supposed to be more job openings this year.</br>
Caruso:That's true. Businesses that had cut back on hiring new recruits for a couple of years are opening their doors again to college graduates. On the other hand, there's a lot of competition for job slots. Young workers who lost their jobs in the recent recession years are competing with college seniors for new jobs.</br>
Takahashi:Maybe Lisa's spending too much time on job-hunting on the Internet and not enough time networking with real people. E-mailing a resume is OK, but meeting people seems just as important to me. I wonder if she's networking with Ben's friends for good tips.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_02">L12-02</div>
Reid:Getting in touch with college alumni or people in her church or synagogue could give her new and different leads.</br>
Caruso:mentioned that Lisa wants to land a job as an assistant in a drug research lab at a pharmaceutical company. She needs temp work while she goes on to earn her Ph.D. in order to be qualified for actual research.</br>
Ben Reid:While Lisa's knocking on doors to get in, we've got millions of workers between 25 and 45 opting to drop out of regular jobs. In some cases, companies nudge them out with attractive early retirement packages. Others get fed up and walk out. Unlike Lisa, many of them are not keen on getting employed again.</br>
Caruso:Some don't want another steady job. Others decide to go back to school, collect disability benefits, live at home with their families or care for elderly or disabled people as unpaid volunteers.</br>
Takahashi:It's hard for me to imagine that people as young as 25 could consider themselves retired. Why are they turning their backs on lifetime careers? At any rate, they're easily replaced. Senior workers who retired in their 50s or 60s are coming back into the workforce.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_03">L12-03</div>
Reid:They need extra income. Their pensions or fixed-income assets just don't generate enough cash flow owing to low interest rates.</br>
Takahashi:The job market can be topsy-turvy as well. On the whole, working people with college degrees are usually less threatened by job loss during economic turndowns. In the latest recession, however, the finance and technology industries were hit very hard. Lots of white-collar jobs went down the tubes.</br>
Reid:In any business threatened by economic doldrums, staff cuts happen. I've heard that one tactic for self-protection is backstabbing. A friend of mine was fired during a crisis. A frightened fellow worker had been badmouthing her behind her back but in front of the boss. This coworker was keeping her out of the loop as a maneuver to claim she was making dumb mistakes and thus alienating clients. Their boss eventually bought into that and dismissed her for incompetence</br>
Takahashi:It's not easy to counteract that kind of a smear. Good rumors don't rocket around as fast as bad ones. With any luck, someone will tip you off so you can set a trap for the character assassin.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_04">L12-04</div>
Takahashi:You can try telling key people that a backstabber, especially one who pretends to be a friend, is in fact spreading rumors to put you down.</br>
Caruso:Then you cross your fingers and hope at least one of those key people catches him or her in the act. Still, although it's scary, that's not a leading reason for getting laid off. Long business slumps are responsible for that. Another friend of mine, in spite of a successful 20-year career and a six-figure income, was suddenly laid off. She joined nine million other workers who were pink-slipped in the same month last year.</br>
Takahashi:Everyone assumes that working hard and contributing to a company's success will be rewarded, but you can't be sure. Who knows what decisions are made at corporate board meetings for reasons you can't fathom? In the end, you may be out on the street and never know why.</br>
Reid:If the economic climate is Ice-cold on the whole, it may take quite a while to find a new job opportunity in your professional field. In the meantime, government handouts are much too meager to cover an upper middle-class lifestyle.</br>
Caruso:Tell me about it. In my case, I hadn't been laid off.</br>

Caruso:I chose to quit. Either way, as a breadwinner you have to face the fact that household expenses must be cut down to the bone. Sure, I'd saved for a rainy day, but that would have evaporated rapidly if I hadn't economized.</br>
Reid:You told me before that you sat down with a financial planner and crunched the numbers.</br>
Caruso:I sure did. For the next 22 months, our family ate hamburger, not prime rib. Clothes were bought at discount outlets, not fashion boutiques. My husband is a minor league baseball coach, but we can't live on his income alone. We both need to work to make ends meet and have a little left over afterwards.</br>
Takahashi:Did that cost-cutting upset your household? I don't mean to be nosy, but did your kids weep and wail? Did you feel cranky and indulge in spats with your husband? I'm curious because I wonder how I would handle my family in a similar situation.</br>
Caruso:Yes on both counts. However, I still kept a stiff upper lip. You have to hold the family together, no matter how down in the dumps you feel. One way to keep an even keel is relentless job searching.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L12_06">L12-06</div>
Caruso: I had canceled our newspaper subscription, so I went to the local library to scan the classifieds. I surfed the Web on a library computer. There were no jobs that fit my field of expertise.</br>
Reid: Like Shuzo. I wonder how I would cope in such a situation. I might be inclined to blow my top at home for seeming to be so useless as a breadwinner for my family.</br>
Caruso: Believe me, you do learn to cope. For a few months. I worked part-time at a fairly distant convenience store where my neighbors wouldn't see me. I got my break at long last.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L13_01">L13-01</div>
Takahashi Shuzo:Ben, it's time you met the new corporate communications manager at Kon-Tiki. Are you free for dinner this week?</br>
Ben Walker:Thanks for reminding me, Shuzo, but it's a zoo this week. I'm simply bogged down knee-deep in work. I have two major clients visiting town, have to complete two proposals and finish an article for a trade publication, all before the end of this week. Reporting and other routine tasks also are eating up way too much of my workday these days.</br>
Susan Caruso:Ben, why don't you hire a secretary? As a vice youre entitled to have an assistant. I've been curious why you haven't done that.</br>
Walker:Well, Susan, since everybody in the company, from the chair- man down, answers their own phones and handles their own correspondence, I'm not sure a secretary would make my life easier. I don't need one just for the prestige of it. Besides, I've worked with one before, but I didn't like the way she was learning all about my personal life.</br>
Dean Reid:Obviously, an increasing number of executives nowadays are choosing to go without secretaries. The same technology that allows secretaries to perform more management-level tasks also makes it easier for them to run their own offices without assistance.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L13_02">L13-02</div>
Walker:Yes, you have voice mail and e-mail and the Internet. It isn't all that difficult to do my job per se, even though I have to devote more time to doing tedious work. But that's the 21st century, I guess.</br>
Caruso:Are you sure, though, it's a good idea to run an office like that? I'm confident that a competent personal assistant would increase your efficiency quite a bit. And we're not talking about a traditional secretary who pours coffee and files reports all day.</br>
Reid:Ben, you'd want someone you can count on to assist you in preparing reports, documents and presentations in general. Add invoicing and bookkeeping to that. Such a person must like the organizational work of managing calendars, planning offsite meetings and attending planning meetings with the whole group.</br>
Takahashi:Because of the nature of work we do and the demands our clients put on us, your assistant would have to be first-rate, She should be able to stay calm under pressure, thrive on multitasking and havea broad range of office skills.</br>
Caruso:A good assistant can free you to focus on your core responsibilities. If you had an assistant like that, it would also make our jobs easier since you're out of the office a great deal.</br>
Takahashi:That should soften him up. But I now suspect that is leery of the cost of hiring an assistant. Isn't that right?</br>
Ben Walker:That hits the nail right on the head.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L13_03">L13-03</div>
Walker:I could hire an administrative assistant. But this department is obliged to cover the full cost. How much of a dent will that put in our target income? We need to know how much that sort of support is going to cost.</br>
Reid:I'd say you have the bases covered. For what we've been talk ing about, the ballpark figure is probably $35,000 in salary. Health insurance and other standard bennies will add to that.</br>
Walker:Let's figure $40,000 all told. Well, maybe not a bad idea. But I'll have to talk to our finance people first to see how that would affect our profitability projection for this year.</br>
Caruso:If you decide to go ahead, can put out the want ad and screen the applicants as usual, so there'll only be two or three finalists to deal with in follow-up interviews.</br>
May Walker:Let's go ahead and find a good executive assistant as soon as we get the go-ahead from finance. I'd like all of you to participate in the ultimate interviews to form a consensus on the best candidate.</br>
Caruso:Sure, Ben. You know, I understood your initial reluctance. But without an assistant we've seen you winding up doing lots of things it doesn't make sense for you to be doing at all. With proper help, you'll have ample time to strategize and to just sit back and think. I'm sure you'll thank us for talking you into taking on a new person.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L13_04">L13-04</div>
Walker:Thank you, Susan. I appreciate the thoughtful comments from all of you. Now let's say we've come that far. The next question is how do we get that someone grounded in what we want and how we work?</br>
Caruso:You have to spell out exactly what you want, from A to Z. Solicit suggestions from him or her on how to get that done speedily and efficiently. Emphasize that we act as a team and welcome-probably her-as a new team member. If she needs to liaise with people other than us, let them know that she speaks on our behalf</br>
Walker:Understood. We also need to touch on the issue of trust. In other words, anything said or done in our department is not to be discussed with outsiders. Like all the rest of us, she'll be bound by signing the confidentiality agreement.</br>
Caruso:Yes, of course, and will brief her on that before she even meets us. Assistants can learn a great deal about our private lives and business activities. If any of that ever became grist for the gossip mill. she'd be out.</br>
May Reid:The secretarial marketplace has really shrunk over the years. At present, we have something like four million secretaries and administrative assistants. The old-fashioned secretary is a thing of the past. The new breed now in demand is computer-savvy or has language skills. I'm sure we'll find the right person.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L14_01">L14-01</div>
Susan Caruso:Hi. Dean. How's your Dad doing?</br>
Dean Reid:His condition's stable. Thanks for asking, Susan.</br>
May Grey:Has his doctor given you a prognosis?</br>
Reid:Yes, she told me that it was a light heart failure. Given no further complications, he'll be back on his feet in a few weeks. He'll need some rehabilitation, including assisted walking, for a while.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:That sounds rather favorable to me. I don't suppose i involved any brain damage. Is there any risk of stroke?</br>
Reid:He had a full battery of scans. The doctor told us there's no risk of stroke. Of course, I'mh keeping my fingers crossed. What he can eat and drink will be restricted for some time to come. And my mother bas a day nurse to keep an eye on him at home.</br>
Grey:Now that you're back here, who's doing the driving</br>
Reid:Mom. for the time being, but I'm concerned about her eyesight She needs to renew her driving license in a year or twa but she may not pass the eye test. In that case, we'll have to make other arrangements.</br>
Caruso:You should check into local community services that offer volunteer drivers for old people or those with physical disabilities So I suppose your Dad won't get behind the wheel for some time to come.</br>
Reid:Mom and I discussed that. We decided to keep him grounded.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L14_02">L14-02</div>
Reid:She took his driver's license from his wallet and passed it to me for safekeeping.</br>
Caruso:Won't that stir up trouble when he's back on his feet and wants to take the car out for a spin?</br>
Reid:Yes, but what made it especially difficult for Mom was that she knew that we were taking away his freedom.</br>
Takahashi:I know Americans don't want to give up the car keys. Driving is the icon of independence in America.</br>
Reid:You're right, Shuzo. By losing a license, older people tend to feel more dependent, depressed and isolated. However, my dad accepted the setback with grace. He said he understood because he had to do the same thing with his father many years ago.</br>
Grey:With a whopping 66 million drivers over the age of 50, an eye needs to be kept on their driving skills. Even that number will shoot upward when the bulk of the baby boomers pass the half-century mark.</br>
Reid:Older people need to be monitored more closely. Look at what happened two years ago.</br>
Grey:You mean that driver in his mid-80s who lost control in a crowded farmers market, right? I think he killed 10 people and injured more than 50.</br>
Caruso:Yeah, it's pretty scary. My mother's only in her 50s but she seems to have difficulty staying in one lane.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L14_03">L14-03</div>
Grey:I don't think it's a simple matter of how old you are. After all, there are people in their 70s or 80s who retain their driving skills.</br>
Caruso:If they're smart drivers, they self-regulate and stay off the road after sunset or when it's rainy. In too many cases, though, caution isn't even considered until an aging driver gets into a major collision.</br>
Takahashi:My grandfather still drives in Japan. Last year, during his annual check-up, the doctor told him that his vision was clouded by cataracts. A quick, simple and safe operation restored his normal eyesight, so he continues to drive.</br>
Reid:Educational programs for older drivers are on the rise and seem to help. These drivers' education classes are refresher courses meant to help drivers sharpen their road skills and are often quite helpful for borderline senior drivers.</br>
Grey:Driving is only one aspect of a much bigger picture in dealing with aging parents, though. In your case, Dean, you live here in New York and your parents live way out west in Utah. How can you lend a helping hand at that distance?</br>
Reid:One problem I already foresee is that my mother may not be able to cope once the day nurse is discharged. We touched on the subject. I suggested she consider selling the house and moving into one of those new apartment complexes with special 24-hour services for senior people.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L14_04">L14-04</div>
Grey:That's one option. My parents live on the West Coast. I keep in touch by telephone and e-mail. Believe it or not, people in their 60s are the leading consumers for computer and Internet services. I set up a computer for them so we can chat on-line.</br>
Caruso:If you haven't already looked into support services in your mom's community, Dean, you may want to do that. Civic centers, churches and synagogues have supervised groups that can handle all sorts of chores as volunteers.</br>
Reid:Good idea. Thanks for that. The day nurse did cheer me up a bit when she told me that senior people these days can look forward t longer lives and better healthcare than ever before. Mom and Dad could live to be centenarians.</br>
Grey:Remember astronaut John Glenn returning to space at age 77? That was seven years ago, and it bowled me over. But there are more and more seniors like him who continue to enjoy a rich quality of life that rewards both them and their families.</br>
Takahashi:Apart from that, Dean, you may want to get him connected to chat rooms on the Internet where he can converse with other senio people who have experienced similar heart trouble-and lived to talk about it. He might learn a lot from that kind of chat group.</br>
Reid:Thanks, Shuzo. Well, at my age, maybe it's time for me to foresee the risks that go hand in hand as I grow old and gray.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L15_01">L15-01</div>
Dean Reid:Good morning, Ben. You look like you're a bit under the weather. Anything wrong?</br>
Ben Walker:No, no, I was just reviewing the writing samples of candidates for the secretarial position. There are some exceptions fortunately, but I'm just appalled by the generally poor quality of writing by the young job applicants. Their writing is in a sort of e-mail shorthand like the cell phone messages that high-schoolers post to each other.</br>
Susan Caruso:Yeah, we're seeing the rise of technologies that emphasize brevity over clarity. But business writing, especially in our profession, should be both concise and clear. Grade school curriculums these days give short shrift to the three R's, so it's no wonder Johnny can't read or write coherently.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:It seems that, in America these days, schooling is focused much more on vocational training rather than on a well-rounded liberal arts education, including the study of literature. Good literature spurs the imagination. If you're not reading good writing, then how will you know what good writing is?</br>
Walker:Hey, look at this. The applicant says in her cover letter that she's a real stickler for grammar and spelling. And she can't spell "grammarar." Can you believe that? [Laughter]</br>
Reid:People aren't reading much either these days. If they want news. they depend on TV newscasts or Internet headlines.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L15_02">L15-02</div>
Reid:When they read, t's mainly lifestyle magazines and tabloids rather than books.</br>
Walker:The poverty of written communication reflects an even more troubling poverty of thinking. Today's kids will grow up to be dys. functional communicators.</br>
Caruso:Actually, business people must write more frequently on the job than previously now that e-mail has replaced the phone for much workplace communication.</br>
Reid:We do need to demand more of ourselves. Why live lives that are trite and cliched? That's the attitude we need to instill in our junior employees. ll of us need to know that clear writing is vital. It's also a skill that needs to be constantly upgraded.</br>
Takahashi:That can be an uphill battle against people who live in a visual society. We're surrounded by visual news media and visual technologies. Too many people are too busy or too impatient to do any reading. What they feed on is sound bites and video clips.</br>
Reid:That's right. This is the digital age. Digital language ignores punctuation and grammar and relies much too much on abbreviations and emoticons. Does anybody write "real letters anymore? That seems to be a lost art.</br>
Walker:When it comes to writing e-mail, English teachers are laughed away. I read a recent survey that said one-third of the workers in major companies do not write clearly.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L15_03">L15-03</div>
Walker:Because of that, U.S. businesses are spending a whopping $3 billion a year for remedial training.</br>
Takahashi:You've heard of the massive education business that teaches remedial writing to grown-ups. Hundreds of colleges, other schools and freelance teachers are involved in evening classes.</br>
Reid:There are also workshops, video classes and online instruction for business and technical writing. Even in high-tech companies, where most employees have advanced degrees, there's a crisis of poor writing</br>
Walker:On the other hand, some companies are hampered by senior executives who don't write concisely. Their inflated language needs to be boiled down, But who's going to say so? How do you tell a top executive in your company that he or she needs better writing skills?</br>
Caruso:We've also got clients who think that the more exclamation marks they throw in, the more forceful their messages will be. Give me a break. It's just childish, more like junior high school kids than thinking adults.</br>
Reid:I just read in a trade journal that our closest competitor has set up an in-house professional writers task force.</br>
Caruso:What does that mean? Aren't we all supposed to be professional writers?</br>
Reid:The article says the quality of writing across our business is in decline. Each of us is supposed to be good at writing, but what if something really special comes up?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L15_04">L15-04</div>
Reid:Suppose a client needs executive speech speechwriting or a bylined article for a top-tier publication?</br>
Caruso:I see. Well. ow many people do we have in-house who can turn out high-quality speeches, for example? A superb speechwriter knows how to organize ideas and put them across effectively in a conversational style.</br>
Takahashi:There's more to it. The speech needs to reflect the speaking style of the person who gives the speech.</br>
Walker:Sure. In the past, we focused on creating specialists in various disciplines, such as public affairs, investor relations or crisis management. As a result, the public relations business has one- dimensional people who may excel in certain areas but lack skills in other areas, such as writing</br>
Caruso:You're right, Ben. It is rare to find good writers who are also good at strategy and can interpret a financial statement, counsel clients and talk to the media or investors.</br>
Takahashi:We don't need Hemingways or Steinbecks, but we do need</br>
Walker:We have to get beyond the view that writing is a commodity top-flight writers because excellent writing is something that must be part of our corporate makeup. service. But since the problem is much bigger than the public relations business, the answer will have to come from society at large. The long term solution must start in the elementary schools.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L16_01">L16-01</div>
Dean Reid:Whew! I've never been so embarrassed in my life. We made such a scene on the street. I can never go back to that restaurant again.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:What happened?</br>
Reid:and I went to this new Chinese restaurant on Park Avenue for lunch. As we walked out, our waiter chased us a block, threw the loose change at us, and angrily shouted, "Cheapskates!"</br>
Susan Caruso:Correction due to slight exaggeration, Dean. He didn't call us cheapskates. It was more like, You need the money more than I do," as he forced you to take the coins.</br>
Reid:Sorry. I was carried away and a bit dramatic, but we did make a spectacle of ourselves. You see, Shuzo, we enjoyed the fabulous dim sum lunch at the restaurant, chipped in S10 as a generous tip and add- ed the loose change. I put the folded bill under a pepper dispenser for a paperweight and left.</br>
Caruso:The waiter obviously thought all he got as a tip was the pennies. nickels and dimes. We tried to explain that to him on the street but he was too excited to listen.</br>
Reid:I'lI bet he was mortified when he cleared the table. I understand. Shuzo, that tipping doesn't exist in your part of the world. Is that right?</br>
Takahashi:That's right. But it's created some complications at Japanese restaurants in the States. A sushi bar I went to last week had a big sign in Japanese saying, "You must tip here."</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L16_02">L16-02</div>
Caruso:I guess people feel so at home that they tend to leave without tipping. Right?</br>
Takahashi:Obviously, that's the reason. At another Japanese restaurant I went to, the waiter brought me a bill that already included a 25 percent tip. Later I found out that they don't do that with their local customers, but with their Japanese clientele they're taking no chance.</br>
Reid:Is that a fact? Sometimes I get tired of the whole business, though. I rode in a limo once with a sign prominently displayed behind the driver's seat saying, "Gratuity not included in the fare." I had to stare at it the whole way to JFK. I don't care for that kind of pushy style.</br>
Takahashi:I find it very cumbersome figuring out how much to tip.</br>
Reid:Calculating the amount of a tip can be dicey for anyone. A simple way to figure it out is to remember that in most states they add 7 to 8 percent for state tax. You roughly double that amount for a tip of 15 to 20 percent.</br>
Takahashi:I once saw a Japanese tourist who had given up. He was holding his wallet out to a taxi driver and letting him take what he wanted.</br>
Caruso:Oh, that could be dangerous in New York. Still, tipping customs vary from one country to another and even one city to another, and it can be quite confusing.</br>
Reid:I once took a client to a fancy restaurant in London and got a little card with the bill.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L16_03">L16-03</div>
Reid:The card asked customers not to leave a cash tip because a service charge is already included in the bill. "Our best reward is that you pay us another visit," it said. Even though the service charge was nonnegotiable, I sort of liked that reminder.</br>
Takahashi:Are there service people we're not supposed to tip? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.</br>
Caruso:Sure. Don't tip owners of establishments where you tip the service providers. The same goes for flight attendants, bus drivers, salespeople and busboys.</br>
Takahashi:How about if the service wasn't good? Can you leave with- out tipping?</br>
Reid:You could try it, but I wouldn't advise going back to that place again. The way I see it, you should always leave something because the tips are often an essential part of the employees' wages. If the service is lousy or nonexistent, you can always choose to go somewhere else next time.</br>
Caruso:That raises the question of reasons for not tipping. Sometimes people don't tip for the wrong reasons. Maybe your rump steak came well done instead of medium rare. That's probably not the waiter's fault.</br>
Reid:Yes, likewise, you can't blame the waiter if the restaurant is out of your favorite Italian wine or the restroom isn't spick and span.</br>
Takahashi:Of course. Those situations aren't due to poor waiters. On another note, is there any objection to tipping in this country?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L16_04">L16-04</div>
Caruso:Oh, sure. There are lots of pros and cons, but I doubt tipping will ever disappear. Tipping has persisted because it's an efficient way to maintain the diligence of employees.</br>
Reid:Besides, if tipping ever disappeared, consider the impact that could have on good service. Why would a waiter go out of his or her way to give great service for no better income?</br>
Caruso:In any kind of business, dealing with people builds personal relationships. In the restaurant business, waiters build those ties with customers. A restaurant can prosper if courteous and considerate service is superb or may die in short order if customer service comes with a gWho cares?" attitude.</br>
Takahashi:We don't get tipped in our field, but the bonding we achieve with our clients does pay dividends in our kind of customer service. The common bond seems to be gratitude for superb service that leads to bigger and better contracts with our clients.</br>
Caruso:That's one way of looking at what we do. Customer satisfaction matters. If you do get tipped up front in your job, though, it's immediate, on-the-spot customer satisfaction that determines your rewards, like in restaurants. In our business, we don't earn rewards in a couple of service hours but over a much longer timeline.</br>
Reid:However you feel about dishing out tips, keep in mind that tipping is anything but trivial. In this country alone, it adds up to $26 billion a year.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L17_01">L17-01</div>
May Grey:Hi, Shuzo. Meet our newest old employee, Rodman.</br>
Todd Rodman:Hello, Shuzo. Good to meet you.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:Good to meet you, too. So you're another boomerang. aren't you?</br>
Rodman:Right you are. I'm joining the ranks of the "retreads" here. I already feel as snug as the bug in the old rug.</br>
Takahashi:How long has it been since you left?</br>
Rodman:Five years. Two years in Columbus with a consumer goods manufacturer and three years in Houston with an oil company.</br>
Takahashi:So were you disappointed that the grass wasn't greener outside?</br>
Rodman:To be honest with you, yes, I was naive enough to leave in the first place. I thought it was time to cut loose and explore the possibilities. The first company I joined seemed cozy and rosy. Over two years, though, I came to realize employees were stressed and edgy but nothing was done about it. Business as usual, with little corporate vision, was not my cup of tea.</br>
Grey:I can see that. You left and landed in another seemingly green pasture. What then?</br>
Rodman:I had three more years of optimistic contribution before disillusion began to set in.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L17_02">L17-02</div>
Rodman:Two months ago I quit and sat on the beach to sort out my priorities all over again. The finger of fate pointed me straight back to MarshEg. I realized what I missed most was the corporate culture here. That's when I picked up the phone and called May.</br>
Grey:first joined us straight from j-school and proved himself to be a star performer. We fought tooth and nail when he said he was leaving, not for more money, but for new challenges on the client side. It's our policy to keep the door open for former employees who want to return. After all, we thought enough of that person to hire him or her in the first place.</br>
Todd Rodman:You know, Shuzo, the company keeps in regular touch with ex-employees and offers a sort of standing invitation for their home-coming. I was on the e-mail distribution list and received press releases, employee newsletters, job listings and other news.</br>
Grey:There's even an alumni association with over 1,000 members who exchange information through MarshEg's home page, which you can access with a password. The main message is that we keep in touch to keep the door open except, of course, to those who were canned for wrongdoing or incompetence.</br>
Rodman:I understand the company has one of the highest rehiring rates in our profession.</br>
Grey:Yes, there were 35 boomerangs with us at the last count.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L17_03">L17-03</div>
Takahashi:How intriguing. That would never happen in a Japanese company.</br>
Grey:We're always eager to welcome back returnees. We've found that they're particularly loyal, in addition to having valued skills and talents. We help that loyalty along by reinstating their benefits. If they stay on board for two years, we reward them with full credit for all of their service years.</br>
Rodman:And now that package includes service awards, stock options incentive plans and vacation and sabbatical tenure. MarshEg's grass has grown even greener while I was away.</br>
Grey:Top management doesn't sit still. The boomerang market is a resource we can't ignore. We do our best to keep and grow our people, but if they make up their minds to leave, the door will not be shut and bolted behind them. That's always been our policy.</br>
Rodman:However, there are still die-hard companies that will not rehire anyone at any level.</br>
Takahashi:I know companies like that. If you decide to leave, it's like filing for a divorce. The reaction can be very hostile. Why don't they realize that, in today's job market, demand for qualified workers is much greater than supply?</br>
Grey:Most do. Well over half of all midsized and bigger companies don't bat an eyelid at rehiring high-profile pros. Simply put, it's very economical. They don't need to be trained.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L17_04">L17-04</div>
Grey:As former employees, they know the business. In addition, it keens their skills out of reach of your competitors.</br>
Rodman:So I guess my experience was a bit out of the ordinary At the end of my two years in Columbus, I handed in my resignation, and my boss called a security guard to lead me out of the building as if I had committed a misdemeanor.</br>
Grey:It was widely reported that that same company recently held an alumni reunion in honor of former employees. Alumni aren't the bad guys anymore. They could be future customers or reliable suppliers or even rejoin the company. Things and thinking have changed.</br>
Rodman:I have one misgiving, though. Will I be put into a position that could bruise egos within Marsh Eg? I'm concerned that I could hurt the morale of coworkers and stir up hard feelings.</br>
Takahashi:You mean they may feel that they were penalized for staying and that quitting is the best way to advance?</br>
Grey:Don't worry. That won't happen. We'll position you strategically so your skills will meet new business needs. You'll contribute to achieving common goals that benefit everybody. Someone with your varied business experience has a self-recommending versatility. You could be a jewel in MarshEg's crown in more ways than one.</br>
Takahashi:I agree. Hope you'll enjoy working with us.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L18_01">L18-01</div>
Susan Caruso:What a relief. All the evening papers are carrying big banner headlines about the Christina Simmons case. She was found uninjured this morning. It's hard to believe she was missing for two months.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:Oh, thank goodness. Christina lives right in your neighborhood, doesn't she? I kept asking myself how I would feel if something like that happened to one of our children. Why did she get into a car with a stranger in the first place?</br>
Caruso:According to this newspaper article, a car pulled up beside her when she was walking home from school. The driver asked her for directions. She told him she's not allowed to talk to strangers. He said that's good advice, but he's no danger because he's a policeman. He showed her a phony badge and offered to give her a ride home, noting that streets aren't safe for kids these days. She decided that might be OK.</br>
Dean Reid:So that's how it happened. It must have been a traumatic experience for her. At least she's safe and sound now.</br>
Caruso:The bad news is that the guy hasn't been apprehended yet. Which means there's still a culprit roaming the streets.</br>
Takahashi:You never expect something like that to happen in your own backyard. I think we have to communicate the message more emphatically to our kids that a stranger can be a danger.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L18_02">L18-02</div>
Caruso:"Don't talk to strangers" is the most common advice, but it has limited value if the stranger doesn't come off as a potential threat to a child.</br>
Reid:That's right. Kids often envision strangers as evil-looking and may not identify a well-dressed, soft-spoken man or woman as someone to distrust.</br>
Takahashi:I see. You have to teach young children that strangers come in all forms and sizes, so they shouldn't talk to anyone they don't know.</br>
Reid:Yes, but today's message is more like "Don't trust anyone." The leaflet I picked up a couple of days ago said, "If a policeman, fireman, mailman or any man or woman in uniform wants to talk to you, don't. They could be a stranger in disguise. Be careful even with people you do know." What a confusing world this must be for the kids!</br>
Caruso:Our kids need to know that anyone who wants to "play doctor" is someone to watch out for. The first line of defense for kids is "yell and tell." When someone tells a child not to yell, that's when they should yell "This isn't my dad!" and scream for help.</br>
Reid:Kids can't always find a cop or a security guard when they're lost or scared. One good move to teach is to go to a mom figure, someone with a child in tow or a baby in a stroller.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L18_03">L18-03</div>
Reid:Mothers are more likely to tuck frightened kids under their wings and get them to a safe place.</br>
Takahashi:My wife and I tell our kids that we will never ask someone to pick them up without telling them first. We've rehearsed routes to school and other regular destinations and pointed out safe places along the way. In Japan that included local police boxes, trusted mom-and-pop stores and medical clinics.</br>
Caruso:It's pretty much drilled into kids that the streets aren't safe. At home and alone may not seem to be dangerous, but can be.</br>
Takahashi:What if the doorbell rings or someone knocks and dad and mom are at the supermarket?</br>
Reid:That I had to handle as a kid. My parents told me to keep quiet. Don't ask who it is and absolutely do not open the door. If it's anything important, the person will come again. They didn't tell me anything about answering the phone, though.</br>
Caruso:It might be OK to pick up the phone and say "hello, but don't ever say that you're alone. You just say. "Mom and dad are too busy to come to the phone right now, so please call later. Then hang up.</br>
Takahashi:That reminds me. Susan, in our family, we all have cell phones.I hadn't considered GPS monitors like youve got, but in view of what happened to Christina, I think it's time to think about it.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L18_04">L18-04</div>
Takahashi:What did it cost you and exactly how does it function?</br>
Caruso:It set me back a tad more than $400, and I wondered, until the Christina case happened, if it was worth it. Now I know for sure. What you need is a cell phone service that enables parents to locate kids using global positioning technology. Dean, you're more familiar with how it functions.</br>
Reid:Yes. Three orbiting satellites, or "birds" as we call them, 12,000 miles above the earth, pinpoint the location of a child's cell phone. The phone then relays its location to the cellular network. The phone service provider takes in the data. Dads or moms can pull up maps that show the phone's location using the Internet or their own cell phones.</br>
Caruso:GPS, or the global positioning system, was launched by the U.S. military in the 1970s. It has been incorporated into the cell phone network and the Internet to sell products and services that provide location information.</br>
Reid:It's estimated that by the end of this year more than 40 million Americans will be keeping track of their kids with GPS cell phone services with location-aware technology.</br>
Caruso:It's a shame to have to go to such lengths to protect kids. I've even heard of parents having their kids carry a fake cell phone if they don't have real ones.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L19_01">L19-01</div>
Takahashi Shuzo:That presentation on online newsrooms from the viewpoint of both public relations practitioners and journalists was an eye-popper. It was well researched, and the speaker really knew what he was talking about.</br>
Susan Caruso:Yeah, like a showstopper in a Broadway musical. The in- depth examples, with visuals of behind-the-scenes screen shots from the actual newsrooms, were well presented.</br>
Dean Reid:I can certainly see now why didn't want to come. As he said, he has no head for high-tech mumbo jumbo. It gives him mental indigestion.</br>
Ben Takahashi:Well, I have to admit that taking in the face of the future is a mental workout.</br>
Reid:Speaking of workouts, did anyone check out the fitness center this morning?</br>
Takahashi:I went around 7 a.m. It was mobbed. I went straight to the front desk and rented a stationary exercise bike and stretch cords. I can work out in my room.</br>
Caruso:Oh, I didn't know you could do that here. So they're bringing the fitness center to you. Sounds like a great idea. I should look into it.</br>
Reid:In my room this morning I led off with push-ups, putting my hands on the edge of my bed and feet on the floor for incline push-ups. Then I locked my feet under the bed for sit-ups.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L19_02">L19-02</div>
Takahashi:On my last business trip to the West Coast, I picked up a free fitness kit that included a yoga mat, dumbbells and an exercise booklet when I checked in. That did the trick.</br>
Reid:I hate to interrupt my daily fitness sessions when I'm on the road. Last month, I had a treadmill installed in my hotel room for a little less than $16 a day.</br>
Caruso:By choosing to work out in your room, you can forgo wandering the hallways and sneaking through hotel lobbies in a sweaty T-shirt. You can also avoid odd looks in the elevator from fellow travelers.</br>
Takahashi:Yep. In-room athletes choose not to be on display to everyone in the exercise room.</br>
Caruso:Sounds like the three of us agree that we need to keep fit. But I see so many people who are way out of shape.</br>
Reid:Right. They don't exercise, claiming they don't have 30 to 90 minutes a day to commit to an exercise regime. Too bad, A daily workout can be built into a day's work at home or at a workplace for 10 or 15 minutes at a time.</br>
Takahashi:It doesn't need to be something grueling like pumping iron or five-mile jogging. It can be freeform dancing indoors or brisk walking outdoors.</br>
Caruso:I'm still proud of the StepUp walking campaign we devised. It was and still is a big hit, thanks to Shuzo.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L19_03">L19-03</div>
Caruso:People who refuse to run will respond to the walking option. That alone won't give you optimal muscle tone, but it does make a difference.</br>
Reid:Did you hear that around 65 percent of us Yanks are overweight? Too busy or too tired to exercise are the usual excuses. Well, you don't have to be a couch potato to watch TV. Put in some time on a treadmill with your eyes glued to a baseball game. While the athletes are getting plenty of exercise, you do too.</br>
Takahashi:Before the opening ceremony this morning, I took a stroll around the hotel. Checked out the shopping mall, peeked into restaurants and coffee shops, picked up brochures on all sorts of stuff and had a chat with the concierge about amenities</br>
Caruso:I felt so jet-lagged after the New York-Hong Kong long haul yesterday that I phoned the concierge and found out about massage therapy. Two hours later I felt revitalized. Tonight I'm treating myself to a facial, and tomorrow maybe a manicure and pedicure.</br>
Reid:Frequent business travelers are demanding such amenities. They tend to be on very tight schedules, but in spite of that, or because of it, they squeeze in stres time for stress therapy. Much like Shuzo, I took a grand of our hotel's facilities and found another formula for stress relief. There's a spa on the 14th floor with a sauna.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L19_04">L19-04</div>
Takahashi:I checked it out. Did you go outside? There's an outdoor garden with ponds, palm trees and a waterfall. There's also a jogging track, swimming pool and two restaurants with scenic views of Hong Kong Harbor.</br>
Caruso:I read that spas are a new wrinkle in the hotel industry. They're a response to fagged-out guests that has caught on fire. Most, if not all, of the major hotel chains are constructing them fast and furious to meet guest expectations.</br>
Takahashi:We'll be seeing increased numbers of hotels that feature spas with regional themes and traditional treatments. Another new twist already coming to the fore is a special package that combines accommodations and treatments. We can look forward to being coddled more and more.</br>
Caruso:What I would like to see is a homegrown spa that features natural hot spring water. There are hot springs in many states, but few of them cater to business travelers. They're usually themed toward seniors who need to soak in them as treatment for woes of old age like arthritis and rheumatism.</br>
Takahashi:Japanese dote on hot baths. We have a whole industry devoted to our hundreds of hot spring resorts. Guidebooks list their various mineral benefits for mild types of maladies. Most of us, though. welcome a soak in an indoor or outdoor bath for the restful pleasure. Maybe that's the tack to take in the United States.</br>

<div id="id_L20_01">L20-01</div>
Ben Walker:MarshEg has been invited to bid on a project for a California-based producer of Hispanic-style cheese. Two other agencies will also pich. In the first phase, the program will be targeted at the Hispanic population in California, but the client is quite bullish about future potential in the U.S.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:Ben, do you mean to say the client eventually wants to send their message to non-Hispanic audiences?</br>
Walker:Sure. The popularity of Hispanic foods is not just a California phenomenon. Despite the growing popularity, however, the cheese remains unfamiliar to many of us in the rest of the country, outside Hispanic circles.</br>
Susan Caruso:Sorry for being so ignorant, but what is Hispanic cheese. and how does it differ from other types?</br>
Walker:Here's our resident expert to answer your questions. Dina?</br>
Dina Domingo:Hispanic-style cheese is crumbly and often eaten as a snack with tropical fruit. The fresh milk flavor makes it pleasing to almost anyone who enjoys cheese. It's mild, not hot and spicy. I just love it.</br>
Walker:It falls into two categories, either "fresh" or "dried." Dried means the texture comes from being salted, pressed and dried rather than aged over a period of time.</br>
Caruso:OK. Where can I find it, and how do I know it's a Hispanic cheese?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L20_02">L20-02</div>
Domingo:They're easy to find. Naturally they're in Latino food markets with Spanish names, but they're also available at large supermarkets. They look, cook and taste different.</br>
Walker:The RFP we received says California is the largest producer of Hispanic cheese, with production more than doubling in the past 10 years from 34.8 million to 82.3 million pounds.</br>
Caruso:Sounds very interesting, but I guess competition must be very keen with European and domestic brands. How can we make it stand out in the crowd?</br>
Walker:Let's go back to square one. and you, Susan, will collect the basic data we need to evaluate the client's target audiences. Then we'll ask to collate the information and seek leads for basic research. On that basis, we'll begin to sketch out possible approaches for the campaign.</br>
Dina Takahashi:There's a cheese manufacturers association on the Web. Their data could be very helpful. Who are the market leaders and why? What are their distribution channels? What unique features give the products special consumer appeal?</br>
Caruso:I'll visit the client's Web site, as well as their competitors, and see how they plug their products. I'll actually go to supermarkets for more info on how they're presented. Valker: While you handle that, we'll begin to evaluate the client as a new business lead. That's a mutual pursuit, of course.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L20_03">L20-03</div>
Walker:While we size up this potential client, we're likewise under the same kind of scrutiny---they want to see whether we're worth the investment they're going to make.</br>
Domingo:I'm new to all this, but how do you approach all that? What do you want to accomplish at the first meeting next week?</br>
Caruso:We have to take care of two things before the first meeting Your research will give us tips on what we need to know in advance. That's one. The second is to ask for a short, written brief outlining the prospect's point of view.</br>
Walker:That's right. Before we have the first meeting. we mine information on the prospect, read it, and commit it to memory. Then we actually sit down with them and lead them toward identifying program needs and goals.</br>
Takahashi:We plan a sequence of discussions to guide the prospect to putting a finger on what the program needs. Several steps are involved in that process. We ask questions in order to analyze the problems and opportunities or barriers and strengths they have. We form an agreement on what needs to be done, in order of priority. We close with a mutual commitment to action.</br>
Domingo:That's still kind of abstract, but I think I get the general idea. How do you follow up on the meeting?</br>
Walker:First we feed the prospect an outline of the points we discussed at the meeting.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L20_04">L20-04</div>
Caruso:What counts in the final round, I think, is chemistry as well as our professional capability.</br>
Domingo:I hope that the outcome will justify all that commitment. But it seems that this is a relatively small company that can barely afford the minimum annual fee of $120,000.</br>
Walker:Good point, Dina. Do they measure up to our minimum acceptance level? A small account is worth pursuing if we foresee growing revenue as a direct result. In this case, it's a "nothing ventured, nothing gained" opportunity. Think of the acorn that grows into an oak tree.</br>
Caruso:That's right. Ordinarily we don't bid on small accounts. They cost more proportionately to administer and service than larger accounts. Moreover, small accounts can be demanding, sometimes unreasonably so. The time spent on servicing small and minimally profitable business is usually better spent elsewhere.</br>
Takahashi:The same goes for prestige. The account may provide "name fame," but again, prestige doesn't put meat and potatoes on the table.</br>
Walker:From the very beginning, we examine the potential for expansion. In this case, we believe that it's worth pursuing as they have genuine potential for expansion. And I have a feeling that the client's needs fit well with our strengths.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L21_01">L21-01</div>
Ben Walker:The buying power of the U.S. Hispanic population is estimated at $450 billion annually. But it isn't just this huge market that's causing food and beverage processors to sit up and take notice. American gringos are responding to the new taste with a resoundino "Me gusta!" We're gathered here today to engage in a dialog and learn, from Dina, about salient features of the Hispanic market.</br>
Dina Domingo:Thank you, Ben. Hispanics form the largest minority market in the U.S. In California, they'll probably become the majority population within the next 35 years. Overall, California's population will rise by 21 million in the next 45 years, and 18 million of that increase will be Hispanics.</br>
Susan Caruso:Wow! I understand, though, there are quite a few sub- cultures within the U.S. Hispanic market, and it's wrong to treat the market as homogeneous. Is that right?</br>
Domingo:Yes, that's right. It's multicultural, not monolithic. The market is composed of subcultures from over 20 countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean and Spain, with the majority, 63 percent, of Mexican heritage. I come from Puerto Rico. Our culture is a far cry from other Hispanic cultures. It's a big mistake to lump us all together. The main thing that does tend to bind us together is Spanish as our mother tongue, along with a list of similarities, such as faith, food preferences and music.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L21_02">L21-02</div>
Walker:So Spanish stands as a symbol of unity, as it were, for U.S. Hispanics. Wherever they're from originally, and regardless of their history, Spanish is the key to their individual and collective pasts. So how does English fit into the situation? Is it commonly used and understood within this varied population?</br>
Domingo:English is the second language for younger and better- educated Hispanics. Most of the time we use Spanish among ourselves, a nod to our common first language.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:What's the best way to refer to this group, "Latino" or "Hispanic"?</br>
Domingo:I use the term lHispanic most of the time. I find it proper because of its main significance, which is people whose countries' official language is Spanish. I use Latino in instances when I'm talking about a cultural theme. Latino is a warmer word that carries tradition, feelings, memories and many other good things.</br>
Walker:Now that's cleared up, let's get down to business. What have you dug up on media, leading off with television?</br>
Domingo:Television commercials display the product, as well as plug it. Seeing what's on the screen matters a great deal to Spanish-speaking lispanics. Around half of the U.S. Hispanics who tune in to prime-time TV are watching programs that are telecast in Spanish.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L21_03">L21-03</div>
Caruso:Is radio programming influential?</br>
Domingo:Yes, it's very effective. Hispanics tend to listen to Spanish radio programs for hours on end, often all day. Whole families may listen to the same station for 25 or 30 hours each week. That's higher than the average American audience.</br>
Takahashi:Newspapers? Magazines? Community newsletters?</br>
Domingo:Community newspapers are very popular, because all of the news is directed to what each particular community wants and needs to know.</br>
Walker:Does event marketing have an impact?</br>
Domingo:It can if the events are effectively presented. It gives you a chance to deliver your message directly to your targeted audience.</br>
Caruso:Should we consider direct-response marketing? A lot of U.S. consumers pooh-pooh direct mail as junk mail. On the contrary, I've read that Hispanics, especially new arrivals, are keen to read it for its educational value, as well.</br>
Domingo:That's true. They feel it lends a hand to learning how to be a wellinformed consumer. Hispanic consumers are said to be three times more responsive to direct mail than the U.S. population in general.</br>
Takahashi:Is it worthwhile for marketers to provide access to their Web sites and telephone services in Spanish?</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L21_04">L21-04</div>
Domingo:Oh, yes, extras like that come across as helpful and friendly. People are pleased that you care and tend to respond in a positive way. A few simple words can bond Fispanic customers to your product or service. Even Hispanics who speak English quite well are delighted to be addressed in Spanish.</br>
Walker:In summary, our strategies that succeed in the general population probably can't be applied to the Latino market. Too many factors are different-histories, contexts, subcultures and market patterns.</br>
Takahashi:That seems to be true anywhere. Pitches that succeed in Japan may not be compatible in China or Southeast Asia. Direct translations of ad campaigns more often than not fall flat in other countries. We need to perceive the Latino market as a foreign market. What turns them on or off? How can we get attuned to that and create successful campaigns?</br>
Domingo:I'm seeing more and more new products or line extensions inspired by Latino tastes or scent preferences. A good example is the new Giante baby food promotion. They've introduced unique baby food flavors that are more appealing to Hispanics. Their flavors feature tree-ripened peaches, hand-peeled bananas and soy-free cereals. They've also extended their brand into juice and spring water products with new labels in Spanish.</br>
Caruso:Thank you, Dina. You've been very helpful. Now it's time to go and find out what's happening with our own ears and eyes.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L22_01">L22-01</div>
Dina Domingo:Look here. Marshall Egler's featured in the morning paper. An op-ed columnist makes very favorable comments on our policy to grant an extra day off to employees on the death of a companion animal.</br>
Ben Walker:It was instituted by Jack Marshall, our CEO, when his dog died from an incurable illness. Jack was traumatized by the loss of his pet. His dog was truly a family member. He's feeling much better now, though</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:We've also been cited in the press as instrumental in working with local humane societies for the recent fund-raising campaign. The reporter I talked to was impressed that we partnered with animal shelters, hospitals, hospices and senior citizens' centers.</br>
Susan Caruso:I mentioned that we matched the animals' needs in placing them in new homes and the fact that we promoted Doggie Day on behalf of our pet food client. That won MarshEg and the client a lot of coverage in the media.</br>
Walker:Jack even changed the title on his business card to Top Dog. He's dead serious about that. I'm inclined to change mine to Big Cheese if we get the Hispanic cheese account. [Giggling]</br>
Caruso:With our clients support, Doggie Day is now celebrated in many parts of North America.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L22_02">L22-02</div>
Walker:More companies and their employees join us year after year for Take Your Dog to Work Day. Even at state government offices where pets are prohibited, workers decorate the walls with pet pictures sponsor a hot dog cookout and let visitors know that pets are up for adoption at local animal shelters.</br>
Takahashi:Some communities sponsor pet parades and competitions and point out how important it is to take home pets from shelters. Humane societies also benefit from tons of publicity.</br>
Domingo:The next big event for us is the New York dog show. There'll be 2,500 dogs and 36,000 spectators on hand, in addition to a sizeable TV audience.</br>
Caruso:It's no wonder the pet industry has doubled in size to nearly $35 billion in the last decade. That's not only pet food. It includes toys, furniture, trainers and fees for dog-walkers, groomers and even pet therapists.</br>
Takahashi:Pet cremation and the safekeeping of ashes is a big business in Japan these days.</br>
Domingo:I was interested in hearing about dog-sitting, a new business. A sitter gets friendly with your pets and then comes by every day to dish out food, play games for good exercise, and clean the litter boxes. It's an alternative to bedding down your pet in a shelter or pet hotel when you travel.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L22_03">L22-03</div>
Caruso:Now that you mention it, I read that professional sitters can handle medications, walk dogs and deal with other kinds of pet care. Pets kept at home have less stress. They feel secure because they stay at home where feeding and exercise routines are familiar.</br>
Walker:I could use up-to-date tips on food. My pooch is in canine middle age. I need to know what dog food's best for him. Should I put him on a special diet? He's a bit chubby, so maybe low-carb chow is in order. Input like that from a vet could keep him healthy and frisky well into old age.</br>
Caruso:Then ask for it. Instead of getting him new gewgaws like a diamond-studded collar or an electric blanket for his doggie bed, invest in seeing to it that he stays in tiptop shape. Check with your vet on new medications.</br>
Takahashi:Pet health insurance was the butt of jokes when it came on the market. Nowadays, it's taken for granted that pets should have the proper degree of medical care, since they are, after all, members of the family. When our Akita was sideswiped by a speeding teenage driver and rushed to the vet with a broken foreleg, my pet insurance more than paid for itself.</br>
Domingo:On the other hand, I slipped into a department store a couple of weeks ago because our dog had a birthday coming up.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L22_04">L22-04</div>
Domingo:I had a matching leash and collar in mind-until I took a look at the price tags. Can you believe $150 for genuine leather? Or $395 for a pet travel bag? How about a $675 cat sweater trimmed with ermine and pink pearls?</br>
Walker:Dog grooming used to be a flea bath and brush down. Now it includes hair dyes and plastic surgery for aging dogs. All kinds of businesses are scrambling to grab a chunk of the pet market.</br>
Caruso:If you've got a product that's a hit with humans, the key is to modify it for the pet market as well. Sell shampoo as a pet product. Persuade hotels to furnish pet amenities such as cat and dog pillows and raincoats or a chef's menu and massage and manicure package.</br>
Walker:Thomlins just did that. They're the nation's largest hair-care firm that launched pet-grooming products that are "tested on humans, so it's safe for your pets," as they say in their ads. Their shampoo with natural Australian tea tree oil to control ticks and fleas is selling like hotcakes.</br>
Takahashi:One poll I saw said pets are popular not only for families with children. There's a trend for married couples to put off having children. Singles are opting for later marriages and living with pets instead. Miniature dogs are very popular because so many celebrities tote them around in luxury handbags.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L23_01">L23-01</div>
May Grey:Another chocolate malt with lunch? You do have a sweet tooth, Dina.</br>
Dina Domingo:I need the sugar for extra energy so I don't fall asleep on the job.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:You look tired. Are you getting enough sleep?</br>
Domingo:Quite frankly, no. For the past few weeks, I've tried to adjust my schedule to be a fellow early bird. I go to bed two hours earlier, but I don't go to sleep any sooner. I get up at 4:30 to be in the office by 6:30, but I still feel half-asleep.</br>
Dean Reid:I know what that's like. I used to be a nine-to-fiver, but to fit in with and Susan, it pays to roll in two hours early. I had a tough time making that adjustment for a couple of months, but after that it wasn't much of a hassle.</br>
Ben Grey:For some time, I enjoyed driving to work despite the downtown traffic jams. Now I take the train. It's a 45-minute commute and not crowded. I can sit comfortably and relax. Is your commute crowded, Dina?</br>
Domingo:It was on the 9-to-5 schedule, but not at 6. I still feel too uptight to sit back and relax, though, like you do.</br>
Reid:I get about seven hours of sleep on weeknights and a bit more on weekends. That's about average for most people. I didn't used to be a morning person. I liked to stay up, crunch popcorn and take in the late shows on the boob tube.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L23_02">L23-02</div>
Reid:That's long gone. Now it's early to bed and early to rise.</br>
Grey:Why not? It makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise, as the saying goes. I do notice that my 6 oclock train is gradually taking on more passengers. There seems to be a definite trend toward earlier work hours.</br>
Reid:It certainly has its advantages. You're not crushed in standing room-only rush-hour commutes, and you get to work in a much better mood. Besides, you can take time for a laid-back cuppa and croissant at an early-bird coffee shop.</br>
Domingo:We've talked about the trend toward early morning store openings. I read that the Department of Labor says something like 29 million American employees are starting their workdays anytime between 4:30 and 7:30 a.m.</br>
Takahashi:Yes, but that doesn't always mean they're putting in longer workdays. It's based on flextime. Everybody's obliged to be onboard for core work hours, but can otherwise schedule their work time according to personal wants and needs. Some people punch out at 4 and head homeward for shopping and other household chores or to spend more quality time with the kids.</br>
Grey:There's another aspect of coming in early. Your clients don't have to wait until 9 or 10 to phone you. My phone starts ringing around 7:30 most mornings.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L23_03">L23-03</div>
Takahashi:For some companies, early-bird work schedules are a competitive advantage. Deals get cut when your rivals are just getting out of bed.</br>
Reid:I'm not only seeing earlier work schedules. I'm also seeing longer commutes. American employees are moving farther away from their workplaces in big cities. Why that's happening is understandable. They want to live in communities where neighbors are friendly, streets are safe, homes are affordable and schools are not overcrowded.</br>
Takahashi:I understand some people do the "extreme commute" of 90 minutes or more. As a matter of fact, they're the fastest-growing commuter group. Their commutes take three times as long as the national average of a bit less than half an hour.</br>
Grey:Another shift that I can see from my train window is companies building facilities near populous suburban areas to take advantage of lower taxes and convenient access to local workforces.</br>
Domingo:My cousins in Los Angeles are considering moving to rural areas for tax purposes and crime-free environments. Recently, on weekends, they get into their cars and head off to scout communities where mortgages on homes are more than affordable. ords & Phrases</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L23_04">L23-04</div>
Domingo:Every mile you drive away from the big city, prices for homes drop down by thousands of dollars.</br>
Takahashi:The farther out, the lower the cost of owning your own home. Way back when, drivers weren't willing to commute longer than 45 minutes. How things have changed. Nearly 20 million workplace commuters, that's one out of six, are opting for much longer commutes.</br>
Reid:My dad can't drive anymore and my mother doesn't want to chauffeur him, so he bought a lightweight racing bicycle to commute to the office. It takes double the time to get there, but he's getting the kind of daily exercise his doctor recommended in view of his heart condition. His commute is largely on flat land, except for a few low hills. I'm all for it.</br>
Domingo:I'll stick with the subway. Combining long-distance biking with a comparative lack of sleep, I might collapse at my desk instead of just stifling yawns.</br>
Grey:Coming back to that subject, I have a book at home that may help you cope with early-bird syndrome in the earliest stage. There are many breathing and stretching exercises that are simple and settle you down for a good night's sleep.</br>
Domingo:I'd love to read it. No matter how tired I feel, I don't want to disappoint and by shifting back to 9 to 5. On top of that. leaving the office earlier gives me more time to hit the books before night classes at the college.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L24_01">L24-01</div>
Susan Caruso:Thanks for inviting us out to lunch, Dean. What's the occasion?</br>
Dean Reid:Something I don't want to discuss in the cafeteria where the walls have ears. To make a long story short, ever since my dad had a heart attack, I've been mulling over a move to work at home with a business of my own.</br>
Takahashi Shuzo:I can see why you want to keep it on the QT. We'll take it for granted that your dad's situation figures in your future plans, whatever you end up doing.</br>
Reid:I want to be close to my parents, but I wonder if I'm really ready to pursue my long-cherished dream to be my own boss. At the moment, I'm full of mixed feelings.</br>
Caruso:Then let's talk it over. First off, you probably don't need to cut your ties with MarshEg altogether. You could be a franchisee, liaising with our West Coast offices for some accounts, including the Hispanic cheese business that we just won. Have you got any other prospects on the horizon?</br>
Reid:My cousin in Salt Lake City runs a medium-sized food company. I've been approached to help develop, orchestrate and carry out a merchandising campaign from a PR perspective. That won't make me a millionaire, but it's a bit of a start. On the other hand, it's my only prospect at the moment. Color me ambivalent.</br>

Takahashi:If you make the move back to Utah, you'll have to start from scratch. If you choose to stick with MarshEg, then you carry on happily with the team you like to work with, but you're still stuck in New York.</br>
Caruso:Let's say you do leave us. After all, if you build and boss a small business of your own, you've made a dream come true. You put your talents to full use and reap the eventual benefits of financial independence. That's the upside. What's the downside?</br>
Reid:Failure. Have I really got what it takes to go it alone? Before I begin, I need a meticulous business plan, must count on endless pep and a flexible outlook, plus have enough financing to cover expenses for at least the first two or three years.</br>
Takahashi:Yeah, a realistic business plan is critical. Without it, no bank will lend you a red cent. Even with financial backing, you may get off to a shaky start and suffer setbacks, so you need to keep your eyes trained on the bull's-eye.</br>
Caruso:For quite some time before I landed my job at MarshEg. I dreamed of setting up a small business for myself. I jotted notes about bright ideas and how to build them into a business. That's the beginning of a detailed business plan.</br>
Reid:Why didn't you go for it?</br>
Caruso:Two reasons.</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L24_03">L24-03</div>
Caruso:A bit of market research let me know the competition in a big city like New York was formidable, all because the market was supersaturated. Then I was tipped off by a good friend to make my fateful phone call to Grey. I haven't looked back since.</br>
May Takahashi:Your business plan doesn't need to be carved in stone, Dean. It's more of a planning tool that guides your way. You may need to modify it from time to time.</br>
Caruso:Keep us in the loop too. Our advice and guidance is free. If you want to be a franchisee, will walk that upstairs and deal with red tape or whatever.</br>
Ben Takahashi:Whatever else you do, don't sit back and assume that business will come to you. Get cracking. Phone people, send e-mail, and visit everyone else who might be able to lend a helping hand.</br>
Reid:OK, now we're talking net working. Last time I went home, I attended a meeting of the local chamber of commerce. When my business is legally registered, I can apply for full membership. In the interrim, I can meet regular members as a community volunteer.</br>
Takahashi:That's good. At my previous company, in its heyday. I looked for and interfaced with higher-ups who could be valuable mentors or gatekeepers</br>
</br>
<div id="id_L24_04">L24-04</div>
Reid:I'm jotting that down with a double underline. Look for good mentors. What was the other type?</br>
Takahashi:Gatekeepers, meaning authoritative people with great influence who can open doors for you. It could be resources you need or contacts who could give you a helping hand.</br>
Caruso:I've seen people go it alone by trying to trade on prestige. They open fancy offices in upscale business districts. One of them poured all of his savings and retirement funds into a lavish office and a chauffeured limousine. In less than six months he was stone-broke, pursued by rabid loan collectors and running for deep cover.</br>
Reid:That won't happen to me. For quite some time, I plan to work from home. I have my own room with a desk where I used to do my school homework. It'Il hold my computer and has drawers for paper files. All I need is a business card, petty cash for local transportation, and a bit set aside for business meetings over lunch.</br>
Caruso:A lot of people dream of having a business of their own, but few of them ever make that move. You can be one of those who make the dream come true. Let me give you one more tip. Invite Grey out for lunch. Talk it over. First she'll try to talk you out of it. If that doesn't do the trick, she'll back your planning to the hilt. Go for it.</br>
