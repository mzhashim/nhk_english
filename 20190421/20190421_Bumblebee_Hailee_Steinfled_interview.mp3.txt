screen and that moment that you're

56
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,150
screen and that moment that you're

57
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,580
screen and that moment that you're
talking about is the first time that

58
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:21,590

64
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:30,260
I guess in a lot of my sort of work I

65
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,710
I guess in a lot of my sort of work I
would kind of try and make sense of the

66
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
would kind of try and make sense of the

67
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
would kind of try and make sense of the
situation if we brought the transformer

68
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:34,730
situation if we brought the transformer

69
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,310
situation if we brought the transformer
element out of it and if there wasn't

70
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
element out of it and if there wasn't

71
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,960
element out of it and if there wasn't
anything there obviously because that's

72
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:37,970
anything there obviously because that's

73
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,420
anything there obviously because that's
what was happening for me in real life

74
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:39,430
what was happening for me in real life

75
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,370
what was happening for me in real life
and this is like this is a moment where

76
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:42,380
and this is like this is a moment where

77
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,810
